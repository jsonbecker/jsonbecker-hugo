      <p>A few months back I wrote some code to calculate age from a date of birth and arbitrary end date. It is not a real tricky task, but it is certainly one that comes up often when doing research on individual-level data.</p>

<p>I was a bit surprised to only find bits and pieces of code and advice on how to best go about this task. After reading through some old R-help and Stack Overflow responses on various ways to do date math in R, this is the function I wrote <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:wrote"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:wrote">1</a></sup>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-r">age_calc &lt;- function(dob, enddate=Sys.Date(), units='months'){
  if (!inherits(dob, &quot;Date&quot;) | !inherits(enddate, &quot;Date&quot;))
    stop(&quot;Both dob and enddate must be Date class objects&quot;)
  start &lt;- as.POSIXlt(dob)
  end &lt;- as.POSIXlt(enddate)
  
  years &lt;- end$year - start$year
  if(units=='years'){
    result &lt;- ifelse((end$mon &lt; start$mon) | 
                      ((end$mon == start$mon) &amp; (end$mday &lt; start$mday)),
                      years - 1, years)    
  }else if(units=='months'){
    months &lt;- (years-1) * 12
    result &lt;- months + start$mon
  }else if(units=='days'){
    result &lt;- difftime(end, start, units='days')
  }else{
    stop(&quot;Unrecognized units. Please choose years, months, or days.&quot;)
  }
  return(result)
}
</code></pre>

<p>A few notes on proper usage and the choices I made in writing this function:</p>

<ul>
<li>The parameters <code>dob</code> and <code>enddate</code> expect data that is already in one of the various classes that minimally inherits the base class <code>Date</code>.</li>
<li>This function takes advantage of the way that R treats vectors, so both <code>dob</code> and <code>enddate</code> can be a single or multi-element vector. For example <code>enddate</code> is a single date, as is the default, then the function will return a vector that calculates the difference between <code>dob</code> and that single date for each element in <code>dob</code>. If <code>dob</code> and <code>enddate</code> are both vectors with n&gt;1, then the returned vector will contain the <a href="http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/r.old.html#elementwise">element-wise</a> difference between <code>dob</code> and <code>enddate</code>. When the vectors are of different sizes, the shorter vector will be repeated over until it reaches the same length as the longer vector. This is known as <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.html#The-recycling-rule">recycling</a>, and it is the default behavior in R.</li>
<li>This function always returns an integer. Calculating age in years will never return, say, 26.2. Instead, it assumes that the correct behavior for age calculations is something like a <code>floor</code> function. For examle, the function will only return 27 if <code>enddate</code> is minimally your 27th birthday. Up until that day you are considered 26. The same is true for age in months.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is probably the first custom function in almost 3 years using R that I wrote to be truly generalizable. I was inspired by three factors. First, this is a truly frequent task that I will have to apply to many data sets in the future that I don&rsquo;t want to have to revisit. Second, a professional acquaintance, <a href="http://jaredknowles.com/">Jared Knowles</a>, is putting together a CRAN package with various convenience functions for folks who are new to R and using it to analyze education data <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:https-github-com-jknowles-eeptools"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:https-github-com-jknowles-eeptools">2</a></sup>. This seemed like an appropriate addition to that package, so I wanted to write it to that standard. In fact, it was my first (and to date, only) submitted and accepted pull request on Github. Third, it is a tiny, simple function so it was easy to wrap my head around and write it well. I will let you be the judge of my success or failure <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:inspiration"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:inspiration">3</a></sup>.</p>

<li id="fn:inspiration">Thanks to <a href="http://mcfromnz.wordpress.com/2013/06/12/updated-age-calculation-function/">Matt&rsquo;s Stats n Stuff</a> for getting me to write this post. When I saw another age calculation function pop up on the r-bloggers feed I immediately thought of this function. Matt pointed out that it was quite hard to Google for age calculations in R, lamenting that Google doesn&rsquo;t meaningfully crawl Github where I linked to find my code. So this post is mostly about providing some help to less experience R folks who are frantically Googling as both Matt and I did when faced with this need.
