   <p>I have written a lot on the internet. This isn&rsquo;t a surprise, I&rsquo;ve been here since the mid-90s. But the truth is, most of what I write on the internet doesn&rsquo;t make me proud. It hasn&rsquo;t made the world any better. It certainly hasn&rsquo;t made me feel any better. Most of this terrible writing is easy to associate with me, because a long time ago, I chose to use my real name as my online identity. Using my real name was supposed to make sure that I would stand by what I said, but the truth is that I am not always my better self on internet forums, Facebook, Twitter, or other places I get to write.</p>

<p>My personal blog is a bit different. The writing I&rsquo;ve done over the years at my own domains has been&hellip; less embarrassing. I don&rsquo;t mean to say that the quality of the writing is any better (it&rsquo;s not); it&rsquo;s just that the extra thought involved in opening up a text editor, writing something in Markdown, and taking the steps to post it has resulted in fewer emotional tirades. I do a much better job of deleting or never completing posts on my blog than I ever did writing somewhere someone else owned. It&rsquo;s too bad the audience here is much smaller and harder to come by.</p>

<p>My blog has always been a testing ground. It&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ve learned how to use Wordpress, Pelican, and now Hugo. It&rsquo;s been a place to think about templating, structure, CSS, shared hosting, Github pages, server management, nginx and the like. This is where I try different types of writing like link posts, lists, professional-ish informational posts, public versions of notes to myself, images, and more. This blog hasn&rsquo;t had a topic or a format. I&rsquo;m not convinced it ever will. For me, a self-hosted blog is meant to be a personal lab bench.</p>

<p>I hope today I am starting what I consider to be the final version of this blog. I feel confident in the domain and name. I feel comfortable with Hugo and the flexiblility of my fully custom theme. I feel great about not having comments.</p>

<p>The look and content will change many times again, but I feel good that from here forward I&rsquo;ll be using and evolving <a href="http://json.blog">json.blog</a>. This is my home on the web.</p>
