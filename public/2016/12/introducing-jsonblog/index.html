      <p>I have written a lot on the internet. This isn&rsquo;t a surprise, I&rsquo;ve been here since the mid-90s. But the truth is, most of what I write on the internet doesn&rsquo;t make me proud. It hasn&rsquo;t made the world any better. It certainly hasn&rsquo;t made me feel any better. A long time ago, I chose to use my real name as my online identity, which means that most of this terrible writing is easy to associate with me. Using my real name was supposed to make sure that I would stand by what I said, but I think the truth is that I am not always my better self on internet forums, Facebook, Twitter, or other places I get to write.</p>

<p>A personal blog is a bit different. For some reason, although it takes a lot more work to get here and reaches far fewer people, the writing I&rsquo;ve done over the years at my own domains has been&hellip; less embarrassing. I don&rsquo;t mean to say that the quality of the writing is any better (it&rsquo;s not); it&rsquo;s just that the extra thought involved in opening up a text editor, writing something in Markdown, and taking the steps to post it has resulted in fewer emotional tirades. I do a much better job of deleting or never completing posts on my blog than I ever did writing somewhere someone else owned.</p>

<p>This site has been a testing ground, my space on the web is where I&rsquo;ve learned to use Wordpress, Pelican, and now Hugo. It&rsquo;s been a place to think about templating, structure, CSS, shared hosting, Github pages, server management, nginx and the like. This is where I try different types of writing like link posts, lists, professional-ish informational posts, public versions of notes to myself, images, and more. This blog hasn&rsquo;t had a topic or a format. It&rsquo;s my personal lab bench.</p>

<p>I think today I am starting what I consider to be the final version of this blog. I feel confident in the name, I feel comfortable with Hugo, I feel good about my fully custom theme being something I can grow with, and I feel great about not having comments. The look and feel and content will all change many times again, but I feel good that from here forward I&rsquo;ll be using and evolving this space.</p>
