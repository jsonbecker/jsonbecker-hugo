      <p>I read a lot of science fiction and fantasy, genres filled with long running book series. Until the last couple of years, I mostly avoided any series that wasn&rsquo;t already complete. First, I don&rsquo;t like truly “epic” sci-fi fantasy. On-going series without an end in sight, or series that go beyond roughly 3,000 to 4,000 pages never end well for me<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. I simply lose interest. Second, I worry that series won&rsquo;t actually reach completion, either because the books are not successful enough or the author gets writer&rsquo;s block<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, or even just getting caught up in waiting way too long between books<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>. Third, I like to actually remember what happened, especially in the kind of complex stories I like to read.</p>

<p>Some series do really well with sequels. I recently read through Kelly McCullough&rsquo;s <em>Fallen Blade</em> series, and although it is complete and I did read the books in succession, they always made a clear attempt to reintroduce everything about the novel and the necessary bits of past events. In fact, McCullough was so good at this , it was almost obnoxious to read the series all in one go<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:4"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>But other books seem to provide no help at all. And I am now deeply invested in several series that have not yet completed. Right now I&rsquo;m finally reading <em>Poseidon&rsquo;s Wake</em>, the third and final novel in Alastair Reynolds&rsquo; <em>Poseidon&rsquo;s Children</em> trilogy. Because it had been so long, I had forgotten critical parts of the earlier two novels that I enjoyed so much. Now, nearly 40% through the book and thoroughly engrossed, most of the key information has miraculously come back to me. But I found it difficult to get through the first 5% or so of the novel if for no other reason than I was trying to remember what was in *Blue Remembered Earth*and what was in Kim Stanley Robinson&rsquo;s <em>2312</em><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:5"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I must admit, I am often impressed with my own ability to recall details of a story I read years earlier when encountering a sequel, because I seem to remember far more of it than expected.  But I wonder, what must the editing process on a sequel be like? How do authors and editors decide what can be assumed and what cannot?</p>

<li id="fn:4">I assume these books must be geared toward young adults and that this impacted the “hand holding” involved in moving from book to book. I&rsquo;m not sure if they&rsquo;re considered YA fiction, but the writing certainly had that feel. Still, they were wonderfully fun quick reads. I read all six books from November 23rd through December 14th.
