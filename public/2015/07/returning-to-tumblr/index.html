      <p>I have had a <a href="http://tumblr.jsonbecker.com">Tumblr site</a> for a long time but never knew what to do with it. What is Tumblr exactly? Is it a hosted blog? Is it a hosted blog for hipsters? Is it a social network? Why should I put content into Tumblr?</p>

<p>I have this <a href="http://blog.jsonbecker.com">blog</a>, but I barely use it. I don&rsquo;t have a Facebook page, because I don&rsquo;t trust Facebook and how it repeatedly changed and confused privacy settings and after college, I rarely found that Facebook was a net positive in my life. Recently I crossed <em>1000</em> followers on Twitter.</p>

<p>I like the sense of control offered by <a href="http://blog.jsonbecker.com/2015/01/taking-control.html">owning where I put content</a>. But the barrier to posting a blog post has always felt high to me. A blog feels somewhat permanent. It&rsquo;s something I want my current and future employers and friends to read it. It&rsquo;s a record of ideas that felt worthy of memorializing. I have tried over and over again to lower this perceived barrier to blogging and failed.</p>

<p>At the same time, I find the quick ability to favorite/like, retweet/re-broadcast, and respond on Twitter to be addicting. It is so easy to give feedback and join a conversation. As a result, I&rsquo;ve probably written more, 140 characters at a time, on Twitter than I ever have on this blog.</p>

<p>For me, Twitter is an ephemeral medium. It is about instant conversation and access. What I dump into Twitter doesn&rsquo;t have any lasting power, which is why it&rsquo;s so easy to toss out thoughts. Twitter is my new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a>, not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging">microblog</a>.</p>

<p>Writing on Twitter in 140 characters often seems to attract the worst in people. It&rsquo;s not just #gamergate, it&rsquo;s me. My ideas are more sarcastic, more acerbic, and less well considered because Twitter feels like an off the cuff conversation among friends. But it&rsquo;s not a conversation among friends. It&rsquo;s not really even a conversation. It&rsquo;s a bunch of people shouting at each other in the same room. Twitter is less a late night dorm room debate and more the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

<p>Which brings me to Tumblr, a service I think I finally understand. Tumblr is Twitter, but for people who take a breath before shouting. It has the same rich post types that Twitter has implemented through Cards. It has the same ability to magnify posts I find interesting through its reblogging feature. It also has the same ability to send a bit of encouragement and acknowledgement through its hearts. But Tumblr also doesn&rsquo;t have the limitation of 140 characters, so I can spread my thoughts out just a bit further. And Tumblr does have a reply/conversation mechanism, but it&rsquo;s just slightly “heavier” feeling than a Twitter reply so I&rsquo;m less likely to just shoot off my mouth with the first thoughts that come to mind. Though Tumblr is a hosted service, it also has a fairly good API that can be used to export posts and the ability to use a custom URL. I could generate more post types on my Pelican blog, but a self-hosted blog lacks some of the social features that are just fun. And the truth is, do I really want to just put a link to a song I&rsquo;m listening to right now on my blog? Is that kind of ephemera really worthy of a blog post? Maybe, but that&rsquo;s not the kind of blog I want.</p>

<p>So I am going back to Tumblr. I have been experimenting for a couple of days and I really like having a place to dump a link or a funny picture. I don&rsquo;t want Tumblr to host my blog, but I do want Tumblr to eat into some of my Twitter posting. I can easily syndicate Tumblr posts over to Twitter, so why not take a little more space and <em>breathe</em> before deciding it is worth sharing something.</p>

<p>Please <a href="http://tumblr.jsonbecker.com">follow me on Tumblr</a>. I think it&rsquo;s going to be really fun.</p>
