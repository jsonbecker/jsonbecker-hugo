   <p>It has been said a thousand times before, but I feel the need to say it again. So much of what Star Wars got right was creating a fully realized, fascinating world. As much as stunning visual effects that have largely stood the test of time were a part of that story, it was how Star Wars <em>sounded</em> that is most remarkable.</p>

<p>Watch that trailer. It has moments that <em>look</em> an awful lot like Star Wars&ndash; vast dunes in the middle of the desert, the Millenium Falcon speeding along, flipping at odd angles emphasizing its unique flat structure. But it also has a lot of elemetns that are decidedly modern and not Star Wars like. <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:shakes"><a href="#fn:shakes">1</a></sup> I think what&rsquo;s most remarkable is I can close my eyes and just listen. Immediately I can <em>hear</em> Star Wars. The sounds of Star Wars are not just iconic, they are deeply embedded in my psyche and embued with profound meaning.</p>

<p>I first had the opportunity to see Star Wars on the big screen it was during the release of the &ldquo;Special Editions&rdquo;. There is nothing like hearing Star Wars in a theater.</p>
