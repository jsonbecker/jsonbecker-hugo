      <h1>Associated Press: Israeli schools not looking so good against OECD peers.</h1>

      I read an interesting article this morning on Israeli schools. Facing extreme poverty among Arab-Israeli&rsquo;s and the ultra-orthodox, Israel struggles to maintain three separate school systems and succeed. It reminded me of some interesting centralized policy reforms in Israel that have led to great natural experiments. For example, so-called Maimonides Laws which capped class sizes at 40, allowed for some really interesting regression-discontinuity studies on the impact of class size 1.

      <h1>GrapheR is an awesome GUI for R beginners</h1>

      If you&rsquo;re just beginning to use R and want a quick and easy way to make some charts/graphs, etc, GrapheR is a great package to quickly produce high quality plots through a self-explanatory GUI. Here&rsquo;s an article in The R Journal today. My only complaint is that GrapheR does not appear to have a way to export the code that produced the graph, which would be a very helpful feature for a beginner who wants to learn the guts of producing publication quality charts in R.

      Here is a doozy. What is the purpose of the GED? Is it a market signal, indicating your employability to hiring agents or does it follow a human capital path wherein earning a GED is actually a process that increases your skill set? The House wants all unemployed workers without a high school diploma to earn their GED. Their explanation is assuming that the GED works purely through human capital theory, e.g.

      <h1>Diane Ravitch, rebuttals.</h1>

      So I wrote a harsh post after reading a harsh article by Kevin Carey in The New Republic about Diane Ravitch. I still standby what I said. Namely, I&rsquo;m very cautious about trusting Ravitch as a reliable narrator of history because I&rsquo;m: unfamiliar with good historiography/methodology so it&rsquo;s hard for me to judge the quality of her work simply from the product itself unaware of a rich discourse around education history in NYC and 20th century America in general that wrestles with, or even corroborates, Ravitch&rsquo;s account certain that Ravitch&rsquo;s more recent writings often mischaracterizes the power and meaning behind quantitative research and exhibits selection bias to fit a particular narrative generally distrustful of public academics, particularly when their writing is mainly outside of their primary discipline.
