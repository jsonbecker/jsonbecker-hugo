      The past few months I&rsquo;ve been learning how to use R. This morning, I decided to try out two first&ndash; importing a table of data that is being read of the web and overlaying location data onto a map. With a little bit of Google skills and just enough R know-how I was able to produce this image: There were a few things that were kind of tricky for me. First, for sometime I couldn&rsquo;t get latitude and longitude components for the addresses.

      The complicated school day is essentially designed so the minimum number of staff are away from kids at any given time. Some folks are trying to combat this with common planning time and other scheduling gymnastics. These attempts are up against a strong opposing priority&ndash; students must be with an adult essentially 100% of the time. Not only that, but the middle of a hectic day focused on teaching is not really conducive to reflection, strategizing, and deep planning on a tight schedule.

      Jessica Lahey wrote an interesting post over on Core Knowledge Blog that I decided to comment on. After I read back my comment, I realized it would be worth copying over here as it&rsquo;s own blog post. The most interesting part of the Chetty, Friedman, and Rockoff study is precisely the most banal- teachers who improve heir students learning as measured by increased achievement on tandardized tests also improve other more distant and relevant factors n children&rsquo;s lives 1.

      I read an interesting article this morning on Israeli schools. Facing extreme poverty among Arab-Israeli&rsquo;s and the ultra-orthodox, Israel struggles to maintain three separate school systems and succeed. It reminded me of some interesting centralized policy reforms in Israel that have led to great natural experiments. For example, so-called Maimonides Laws which capped class sizes at 40, allowed for some really interesting regression-discontinuity studies on the impact of class size 1.

      If you&rsquo;re just beginning to use R and want a quick and easy way to make some charts/graphs, etc, GrapheR is a great package to quickly produce high quality plots through a self-explanatory GUI. Here&rsquo;s an article in The R Journal today. My only complaint is that GrapheR does not appear to have a way to export the code that produced the graph, which would be a very helpful feature for a beginner who wants to learn the guts of producing publication quality charts in R.
