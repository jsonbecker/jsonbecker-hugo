      When discussing policy in Rhode Island, I almost always encounter two bizarre arguments.
 Rhode Island is completely unique. Ideas from other places don&rsquo;t adequately take into account our local context. What is working there either won&rsquo;t work here or isn&rsquo;t really comparable to our situation here. What is happening nationally is directly applicable to Rhode Island. We can make broad sweeping statements about a set of policies, ideas, or institutions currently in play in Rhode Island without any knowledge of how things are going locally and how it&rsquo;s different from other places.

      An initial proposal has been made to the city of Providence and state of Rhode Island to keep the PawSox in Rhode Island and move them to a new stadium along the river in Providence.
The team is proposing that they privately finance all of the construction costs of the stadium while the land remains state (or city? I am not clear) owned. The state will lease the land underneath the stadium (the real value) with an option to buy for 30 years at $1 a year.

      Severing My Daemon When I was in high school, I piggy-backed on a friend&rsquo;s website to host a page for my band. We could post pictures, show locations and dates, lyrics, and pretend like we produced music people cared about. It was mostly a fun way for me to play with the web and something to show folks when I said I played guitar and sang in a band. One day, my friend canceled his hosting.

      A few thoughts:
 This is a very interesting way to take advantage of a number of existing Amazon technologies&ndash;primarily their payment processing and review system. Services are an increasingly important part of the economy and is less subject to commoditization. This is Amazon dipping into a massive growth area by commoditizing discovery and payment. It also offloads some of the risk from both sides of the transaction. It&rsquo;s very bold, possibly brilliant.
