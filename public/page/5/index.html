      I have never found dictionaries or even a thesaurus particularly useful as part of the writing process. I like to blame this on my lack of creative careful writing.
But just maybe, I have simply been using the wrong dictionaries. It is hard not to be seduced by the seeming superiority of Webster&rsquo;s original style. A dictionary that is one-part explanatory and one-part exploratory provides a much richer experience of English as an enabler of ideas that transend meager vocabulary.

      I had never thought of a use for Brett Terpstra&rsquo;s Marky the Markdownifier before listening today&rsquo;s Systematic. Why would I want to turn a webpage into Markdown?
When I heard that Marky has an API, I was inspired. Pinboard has a &ldquo;description&rdquo; field that allows up to 65,000 characters. I never know what to put in this box. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great to put the full content of the page in Markdown into this field?

      I frequently work with private data. Sometimes, it lives on my personal machine rather than on a database server. Sometimes, even if it lives on a remote database server, it is better that I use locally cached data than query the database each time I want to do analysis on the data set. I have always dealt with this by creating encrypted disk images with secure passwords (stored in 1Password). This is a nice extra layer of protection for private data served on a laptop, and it adds little complication to my workflow.

      Education data often come in annual snapshots. Each year, students are able to identify anew, and while student identification numbers may stay the same, names, race, and gender can often change. Sometimes, even data that probably should not change, like a date of birth, is altered at some point. While I could spend all day talking about data collection processes and automated validation that should assist with maintaining clean data, most researchers face multiple characteristics per student, unsure of which one is accurate.

      <h1>Latinos in Rhode Island Face Housing Burden</h1>

      We burden Latinos (and other traditionally underserved communities) with expensive housing because of the widespread practice of using homestead exemptions in Rhode Island. By lowering the real estate tax rate, typically by 50%, for owner occupied housing, we dramatically inflate the tax rate paid by Rhode Islanders who are renting.
Echoing a newly filed lawsuit in New York City over discriminatory real estate tax regimes, this new report emphasizes the racist incentives built into our property tax.
