      I have not had the opportunity to read Paul Tough&rsquo;s newest book on &ldquo;grit&rdquo;1. I have, however, read Paul Tough&rsquo;s New York Times Magazine article on grit and recently listened to an EconTalk podcast where he discussed How Children Succeed.
The thrust of Tough&rsquo;s argument, if I were to be so bold, is that there is a definable set of non-cognitive skills, called &ldquo;grit&rdquo;, that are at least as important as academic achievement in determining long-term positive outcomes for kids.

      <h1>What Can Management Do? iOS6 Maps Monday-Morning Quarterbacking</h1>

      Philip Elmer-DeWitt has suggested the iOS6 Maps debacle falls on the shoulders of Scott Forstall1. When I first read the piece, I felt like it was unfair to blame management for this kind of failure. In my experience, the Maps application is wonderful software. The turn-by-turn directions are elegant and beautiful. The vector-based maps load fast and use substantially less data. The reality is the Map app is great; the data are less so.

      Bruno is a skeptic on standards-based grading. He seems to think that &ldquo;mastery of content&rdquo; is too abstract for students to work toward and rightly cites evidence that motivation and changed behavior are tightly linked to a sense of efficacy, which in turn is tightly linked to feeling as though you know precisely what to do to get to a particular outcome.
But isn&rsquo;t mastery of content essentially, &ldquo;Do well on your assignments and tests&rdquo;?

      So I have this great little custom function I&rsquo;ve used when looking at survey data in R. I call this function pull(). The goal of pull() is to quickly produce frequency tables with n sizes from individual-level survey data.
Before using pull(), I create a big table that includes information about the survey questions I want to pull. The data are structured like this:
      quest

      I like paying for good software. There are applications I use every day, some for hours a day, that make my experience on the web and on my computers better. I have paid for Reeder on three platforms, Tweetbot on two1, Pinboard, and many others. I like to pay, because I value my time, my experience, and my productivity.
I also like to pay because I value my privacy.
Don&rsquo;t get me wrong&ndash; I am a Google addict, using Gmail practically from the beginning, GChat, Google Calendar, Google+, Google Reader, etc, etc.
