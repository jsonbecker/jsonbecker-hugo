      Update: Please see below for two solutions.
I have grown increasingly unhappy with Wordpress lately. My blog is simple. My design tastes are simple. My needs are simple. I like control. I am a geek. And I really need an excuse to learn Python, which seems to be rapidly growing into one of the most important programming languages for a data analyst.
I have decided to migrate this blog over to Pelican, a static site generator written in Python.

      It is so tempting to try to apply cognitive science results in education. It seems like an obvious step on the long road of moving education from a field of theory and philosophies to one more grounded in empirical research. Yet, learning myths are persistent. Even scarier, &ldquo;those who know the most about neuroscience also believe the most myths.&ldquo;
Educators may have the best intentions when trying to infuse their practice with evidence, but they all too often are not equipped as critical consumers of research.

      Apple has released the iPad Mini. Microsoft unveiled the Surface RT. Google has expanded its play with the Nexus 4 (phone) and 10 (tablet) to sandwich the previously released 7. In virtually every review of these new devices the Apple advantage was ecosystem.
Time and time again, following descriptions of well designed and built hardware 1, reviewers were forced to add some form of, &ldquo;But the ecosystem cannot compete with Apple&rsquo;s 275,000 tablet-optimized application.

      I like this piece in Slate on Paul Cuffee Middle School, a charter school right here in Providence. Most of what I know about child development seems to suggest that middle schools are sort of ridiculous. At the moment children are looking for role models and close relationships with adults (and not just the kids around them), we decide that kids should have many teachers, teachers should have higher loads, and the kids stay consistent while the adults change constantly.

      I have been meaning to write this post for the past couple of weeks. Like most other people, I am constantly experimenting with different ways to publish and share my thoughts and engage with social networking. Lately, I have settled into what feels like an &ldquo;end state&rdquo; workflow1. I will devote a future post to the details of how I manage my online reading, writing, and sharing workflow but for now I just wanted to let folks know where they can find me.
