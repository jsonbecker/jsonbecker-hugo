      How many times have you written R functions that start with a bunch of code that looks like this?
my_funct &lt;- function(dob, enddate = &quot;2015-07-05&quot;){ if (!inherits(dob, &quot;Date&quot;) | !inherits(enddate, &quot;Date&quot;)){ stop(&quot;Both dob and enddate must be Date class objects&quot;) } ... }  Because R was designed to be interactive, it is incredibly tolerant to bad user input. Functions are not type safe, meaning function arguments do not have to conform to specified data types.

      When discussing policy in Rhode Island, I almost always encounter two bizarre arguments.
 Rhode Island is completely unique. Ideas from other places don&rsquo;t adequately take into account our local context. What is working there either won&rsquo;t work here or isn&rsquo;t really comparable to our situation here. What is happening nationally is directly applicable to Rhode Island. We can make broad sweeping statements about a set of policies, ideas, or institutions currently in play in Rhode Island without any knowledge of how things are going locally and how it&rsquo;s different from other places.

      An initial proposal has been made to the city of Providence and state of Rhode Island to keep the PawSox in Rhode Island and move them to a new stadium along the river in Providence.
The team is proposing that they privately finance all of the construction costs of the stadium while the land remains state (or city? I am not clear) owned. The state will lease the land underneath the stadium (the real value) with an option to buy for 30 years at $1 a year.

      A few thoughts:
 This is a very interesting way to take advantage of a number of existing Amazon technologies&ndash;primarily their payment processing and review system. Services are an increasingly important part of the economy and is less subject to commoditization. This is Amazon dipping into a massive growth area by commoditizing discovery and payment. It also offloads some of the risk from both sides of the transaction. It&rsquo;s very bold, possibly brilliant.

      It has been said a thousand times before, but I feel the need to say it again. So much of what Star Wars got right was creating a fully realized, fascinating world. As much as stunning visual effects that have largely stood the test of time were a part of that story, it was how Star Wars sounded that is most remarkable.
Watch that trailer. It has moments that look an awful lot like Star Wars&ndash; vast dunes in the middle of the desert, the Millenium Falcon speeding along, flipping at odd angles emphasizing its unique flat structure.

      Because of the primacy of equity as a goal in school finance system design, the formulas disproportionately benefit less wealthy districts and those with high concentrations of needier students. &hellip; because of the universal impact on communities, school finance legislation requires broad political buy-in.
 I think it is worth contrasting the political realities of constructing school finance law with the need and justification for state funding of education in the first place.

Teaching in low performing schools is challenging.

      The Vergara v. California case has everyone in education talking. Key teacher tenure provisions in California are on the ropes, presumably because of the disparate impact on teacher, annd therefore education, quality for students who are less fortunate.
I have fairly loosely held views about the practice of tenure itself and the hiring and firing of teachers. However, I have strongly held views that unions made mistake with their efforts to move a lot of rules about the teaching labor market into state laws across the country.

      I have never found dictionaries or even a thesaurus particularly useful as part of the writing process. I like to blame this on my lack of creative careful writing.
But just maybe, I have simply been using the wrong dictionaries. It is hard not to be seduced by the seeming superiority of Webster&rsquo;s original style. A dictionary that is one-part explanatory and one-part exploratory provides a much richer experience of English as an enabler of ideas that transend meager vocabulary.

      I frequently work with private data. Sometimes, it lives on my personal machine rather than on a database server.

I have always dealt with this by creating encrypted disk images with secure passwords (stored in 1Password). This is a nice extra layer of protection for private data served on a laptop, and it adds little complication to my workflow.

      Education data often come in annual snapshots.

While I could spend all day talking about data collection processes and automated validation that should assist with maintaining clean data, most researchers face multiple characteristics per student, unsure of which one is accurate.

Echoing a newly filed lawsuit in New York City over discriminatory real estate tax regimes, this new report emphasizes the racist incentives built into our property tax.
