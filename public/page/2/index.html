      I have been fascinated with assertive programming in R since this from 2015 1. Tony Fischetti wrote a great blog post to announce assertr 2.0&rsquo;s release on CRAN that really clarified the package&rsquo;s design.
UseRs often do crazy things that no sane developer in another language would do. Today I decided to build a way to check foreign key constraints in R to help me learn the assertr package.

      Here&rsquo;s a fun common task. I have a data set that has a bunch of codes like:
   Name Abbr Code     Alabama AL 01   Alaska AK 02   Arizona AZ 04   Arkansas AR 05   California CA 06   Colorado CO 08   Connecticut CT 09   Delaware DE 10    All of your data is labeled with the code value.

      One of my goals for 2017 is to contribute more to the R open source community. At the beginning of last year, I spent a little time helping to refactor rio. It was one of the more rewarding things I did in all of 2016. It wasn&rsquo;t a ton of work, and I feel like I gained a lot of confidence in writing R packages and using S3 methods. I wrote code that R users download and use thousands of times a month.

      Do you believe&hellip; that this is about the rule of law, and that if we lose this, we&rsquo;re going to lose it all.
 Now-Chief Strategist to the President Steve Bannon said this on his radio program while talking to now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions about immigration reform. When listening to this portion of The Daily1, I was angry. I thought we were past believing the law determines what is moral?

      You can check my Goodreads profile. I love science fiction and fantasy. And I know in 2017 and everyone has already observed the dominance of &ldquo;geek culture&rdquo;, with the dominance of Disney properties from Marvel and now Star Wars. Hell, Suicide Squad won a goddamn Oscar.
