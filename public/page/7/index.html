      My Democracy Prep colleague Lindsay Malanga and I often say we should start an organization called the Coalition of Pretty Good Schools. We&rsquo;d start with the following principles.
 Every child must have a safe, warm, disruption-free classroom as a non-negotiable, fundamental right. All children should be taught to read using phonics-based instruction. All children must master basic computational skills with automaticity before moving on to higher mathematics. Every child must be given a well-rounded education that includes science, civics, history, geography, music, the arts, and physical education.

      James over at TransportPVD has a great post today talking about a Salt Lake City ordinance that makes property owners responsible for providing a bond that funds the landscaping and maintenance of vacant lots left after demolition. I love this as much as he does and would probably add several other provisions (like forfeiting any tax breaks on that property or any other property in the city and potentially forfeiture of the property itself if a demolition was approved based on site plans that are not adhered to within a given time frame).

      We find that public schools offered practically zero return education on the margin, yet they did enjoy significant political and financial support from local political elites, if they taught in the “right” language of instruction.
 One thing that both progressives and libertarians agree upon are that social goals of education are woefully underappreciated and considered in the current school reform discussion. Both school choice and local, democratic control of schools are reactions to centralization resulting in &ldquo;elites&hellip; [selecting] the &lsquo;right&rsquo; language of instruction.

      Update &gt; Turns out the original code below was pretty messed up. All kinds of little errors I didn&rsquo;t catch. I&rsquo;ve updated it below. There are a lot of options to refactor this further that I&rsquo;m currently considering. Sometimes it is really hard to know just how flexible something this big really should be. I think I am going to wait until I start developing tests to see where I land.

      <h1>A Different Angle on PISA</h1>

      I wanted to call attention to these interesting PISA results. Turns out that student anxiety in the United States is lower than the OECD average and belief in ability is higher 1. I thought that all of the moves in education since the start of standard&rsquo;s based reform were supposed to be generating tremendous anxiety and failing to produce students who had high sense of self-efficacy?
It is also worth noting that students in the United States were more likely to skip out on school dand this had a higher than typical impact on student performance.
