      James over at TransportPVD has a great post today talking about a Salt Lake City ordinance that makes property owners responsible for providing a bond that funds the landscaping and maintenance of vacant lots left after demolition. I love this as much as he does and would probably add several other provisions (like forfeiting any tax breaks on that property or any other property in the city and potentially forfeiture of the property itself if a demolition was approved based on site plans that are not adhered to within a given time frame).

      We find that public schools offered practically zero return education on the margin, yet they did enjoy significant political and financial support from local political elites, if they taught in the “right” language of instruction.
 One thing that both progressives and libertarians agree upon are that social goals of education are woefully underappreciated and considered in the current school reform discussion. Both school choice and local, democratic control of schools are reactions to centralization resulting in &ldquo;elites&hellip; [selecting] the &lsquo;right&rsquo; language of instruction.

      I wanted to call attention to these interesting PISA results. Turns out that student anxiety in the United States is lower than the OECD average and belief in ability is higher 1. I thought that all of the moves in education since the start of standard&rsquo;s based reform were supposed to be generating tremendous anxiety and failing to produce students who had high sense of self-efficacy?
It is also worth noting that students in the United States were more likely to skip out on school dand this had a higher than typical impact on student performance.

      Although it clocks in at 40+ pages, this is a worthwhile and relatively fast read for anyone in education policy on the future of assessment if we&rsquo;re serious about college and career readiness.

I think this paper is meant for national and state level policy-makers, and so my major quibble is I think this is much more valuable for a district-level audience.

      To recap, the first study discussed above established that children from disadvantaged backgrounds know less about a topic (i.e., birds) than their middle-class peers. Next, in study two, the researchers showed that differences in domain knowledge influenced children&rsquo;s ability to understand words out of context, and to comprehend a story. Moreover, poor kids — who also had more limited knowledge — perform worse on these tasks than did their middle class peers.

      More schooling, reoriented calendar Wider range of higher education Cheaper four-year degrees Eliminate property tax-based public education   This is an interesting list. I don&rsquo;t agree with number four. There are several benefits to using property taxes not the least of which is their stability and lagged response during traditional economic downturns. However, there are many things we should do to reform our revenue system for education. I am keen on more taxes on &ldquo;property&rdquo;, using land value taxes that are levvied either statewide or regionally to address some of the inequities traditional, highly localized property taxes can lead to.

      How do we calculate student mobility? I am currently soliciting responses from other data professionals across the country.

      One of the most challenging aspects of being a data analyst is translating programmatic terms like &ldquo;student mobility&rdquo; into precise business rules. Almost any simple statistic involves a series of decisions that are often opaque to the ultimate users of that statistic.
Documentation of business rules is a critical aspect of a data analysts job that, in my experience, is often regrettably overlooked. If you have ever tried to reproduce someone else&rsquo;s analysis, asked different people for the same statistic, or tried to compare data from multiple years, you have probably encountered difficulties getting a consistent answer on standard statistics, e.
