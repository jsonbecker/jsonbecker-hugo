      One of my goals for 2017 is to contribute more to the R open source community. At the beginning of last year, I spent a little time helping to refactor rio. It was one of the more rewarding things I did in all of 2016. It wasn&rsquo;t a ton of work, and I feel like I gained a lot of confidence in writing R packages and using S3 methods. I wrote code that R users download and use thousands of times a month.

      Do you believe&hellip; that this is about the rule of law, and that if we lose this, we&rsquo;re going to lose it all.
 Now-Chief Strategist to the President Steve Bannon said this on his radio program while talking to now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions about immigration reform. When listening to this portion of The Daily1, I was angry. I thought we were past believing the law determines what is moral?

      You can check my Goodreads profile. I love science fiction and fantasy. And I know in 2017 and everyone has already observed the dominance of &ldquo;geek culture&rdquo;, with the dominance of Disney properties from Marvel and now Star Wars. Hell, Suicide Squad won a goddamn Oscar.

      It shouldn&rsquo;t be an act of defiance to expect brazen sexual harassment and discrimination will result in consequences for its perpetrators.
Now a collective will organize minions to scour our past lives, public and private, to ensure that victims never forget they are victims and never stop being victimized.
It shouldn&rsquo;t be an act of defiance to express concern about the impacts of the extremely wealthy funneling hundreds of millions of dollars into a private corporation whose core business practice involves brazenly breaking the law until they change the law.

      &ldquo;I just got an Amazon Echo and surprisingly, I really love it.&rdquo;
 In one form or another, this story has repeated again and again across the internet. So while the recent headline seemed to be &ldquo;Amazon&rsquo;s Alexa is everywhere at CES 2017&rdquo;, it really feels like this year was the Amazon Alexa year.
I have an Amazon Echo. I bought around a year ago during a sale as the buzz seemed to have peaked 1.
