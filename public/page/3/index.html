      A few thoughts: This is a very interesting way to take advantage of a number of existing Amazon technologies&ndash;primarily their payment processing and review system. Services are an increasingly important part of the economy and is less subject to commoditization. This is Amazon dipping into a massive growth area by commoditizing discovery and payment. It also offloads some of the risk from both sides of the transaction. It&rsquo;s very bold, possibly brilliant.

      It has been said a thousand times before, but I feel the need to say it again. So much of what Star Wars got right was creating a fully realized, fascinating world. As much as stunning visual effects that have largely stood the test of time were a part of that story, it was how Star Wars sounded that is most remarkable. Watch that trailer. It has moments that look an awful lot like Star Wars&ndash; vast dunes in the middle of the desert, the Millenium Falcon speeding along, flipping at odd angles emphasizing its unique flat structure.

      Because of the primacy of equity as a goal in school finance system design, the formulas disproportionately benefit less wealthy districts and those with high concentrations of needier students. &hellip; because of the universal impact on communities, school finance legislation requires broad political buy-in. I think it is worth contrasting the political realities of constructing school finance law with the need and justification for state funding of education in the first place.

      There are some basic facts about the teacher labor market that are inconvenient for many folks working to improve education. I am going to go through a few premises that I think should be broadly accepted and several lemma and contentions that I hope clarifies my own view on education resources and human capital management. Teaching in low performing schools is challenging. If I am looking for a job, all else being equal, I will generally not choose the more challenging one.

      November marks the start of National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo). The quick version is folks band together and support each other to write 50,000 words in November. I would love to write a novel one day. I am not sure I could do it well, but I am pretty sure I could hit 50,000-80,000 words if I dedicated time to tell a story. I don&rsquo;t have a story to tell. So this year, I have decided to not feel guilty about skipping out on another NaNoWriMo (always the reader, never the author), and instead I am modifying it to meet my needs.
