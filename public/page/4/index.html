      I read a lot of science fiction and fantasy, genres filled with long running book series. Until the last couple of years, I mostly avoided any series that wasn&rsquo;t already complete. First, I don&rsquo;t like truly “epic” sci-fi fantasy. On-going series without an end in sight, or series that go beyond roughly 3,000 to 4,000 pages never end well for me1. I simply lose interest. Second, I worry that series won&rsquo;t actually reach completion, either because the books are not successful enough or the author gets writer&rsquo;s block2, or even just getting caught up in waiting way too long between books3.

      I have had a Tumblr site for a long time but never knew what to do with it. What is Tumblr exactly? Is it a hosted blog? Is it a hosted blog for hipsters? Is it a social network? Why should I put content into Tumblr?
I have this blog, but I barely use it. I don&rsquo;t have a Facebook page, because I don&rsquo;t trust Facebook and how it repeatedly changed and confused privacy settings and after college, I rarely found that Facebook was a net positive in my life.

      How many times have you written R functions that start with a bunch of code that looks like this?
my_funct &lt;- function(dob, enddate = &quot;2015-07-05&quot;){ if (!inherits(dob, &quot;Date&quot;) | !inherits(enddate, &quot;Date&quot;)){ stop(&quot;Both dob and enddate must be Date class objects&quot;) } ... }  Because R was designed to be interactive, it is incredibly tolerant to bad user input. Functions are not type safe, meaning function arguments do not have to conform to specified data types.

      When discussing policy in Rhode Island, I almost always encounter two bizarre arguments.
 Rhode Island is completely unique. Ideas from other places don&rsquo;t adequately take into account our local context. What is working there either won&rsquo;t work here or isn&rsquo;t really comparable to our situation here. What is happening nationally is directly applicable to Rhode Island. We can make broad sweeping statements about a set of policies, ideas, or institutions currently in play in Rhode Island without any knowledge of how things are going locally and how it&rsquo;s different from other places.

      An initial proposal has been made to the city of Providence and state of Rhode Island to keep the PawSox in Rhode Island and move them to a new stadium along the river in Providence.
The team is proposing that they privately finance all of the construction costs of the stadium while the land remains state (or city? I am not clear) owned. The state will lease the land underneath the stadium (the real value) with an option to buy for 30 years at $1 a year.
