      A few months back I wrote some code to calculate age from a date of birth and arbitrary end date. It is not a real tricky task, but it is certainly one that comes up often when doing research on individual-level data.
I was a bit surprised to only find bits and pieces of code and advice on how to best go about this task. After reading through some old R-help and Stack Overflow responses on various ways to do date math in R, this is the function I wrote 1:

      Apple will be revealing new details for both of its major operating systems at WWDC on June 10, 2013. The focus of much speculation has been how Apple will improve multi-tasking and inter-app communication in iOS7. As batteries have grown, CPUs have become increasingly powerful, and the application ecosystem has matured 1, the iOS sandboxing model has felt increasingly limiting and outdated.
I think that there is a simple change that could dramatically increase the effectiveness of multitasking on iOS by re-examining how application switching works.

      One thing I really dislike about Google Reader is it replaces the links to posts in my RSS feed. My Pinboard account is littered with links that start with http://feedproxy.google.com. I am quite concerned that with the demise of Google Reader on July 1, 2013, these redirects will no longer work.
It&rsquo;s not just Google that obscures the actually address of links on the internet. The popularity of using link shortening services, both to save characters on Twitter and to collect analytics, has proliferated the Internet of Redirects.

      It is so tempting to try to apply cognitive science results in education. It seems like an obvious step on the long road of moving education from a field of theory and philosophies to one more grounded in empirical research. Yet, learning myths are persistent. Even scarier, &ldquo;those who know the most about neuroscience also believe the most myths.&ldquo;
Educators may have the best intentions when trying to infuse their practice with evidence, but they all too often are not equipped as critical consumers of research.

At the moment children are looking for role models and close relationships with adults (and not just the kids around them), we decide that kids should have many teachers, teachers should have higher loads, and the kids stay consistent while the adults change constantly.

The thrust of Tough&rsquo;s argument, if I were to be so bold, is that there is a definable set of non-cognitive skills, called &ldquo;grit&rdquo;, that are at least as important as academic achievement in determining long-term positive outcomes for kids.

The turn-by-turn directions are elegant and beautiful. The vector-based maps load fast and use substantially less data. The reality is the Map app is great; the data are less so.

But isn&rsquo;t mastery of content essentially, &ldquo;Do well on your assignments and tests&rdquo;?

      Ted Nesi was gracious in offering me a guest spot on his blog, Nesi&rsquo;s Notes this week to discuss education funding in Woonsocket. The main conclusions of my post are:
​1. Woonsocket has not increased local funding for education over the last fifteen years despite massive increases in education expenditures in Rhode Island and nationwide.
​2. General education aid from the state has rapidly increased over the same period, demonstrating that a lack of sufficient revenue at Woonsocket Public Schools is first, if not exclusively, a local revenue problem.

Does the state have a legal obligation to fiscally ensure that Woonsocket students are receiving an equitable, adequate, and meaningful education? San Antonio v. Rodriquez, a landmark Supreme Court case decided in 1973 determined that there was no fundamental right to education guaranteed by the U.

      There are several questions that come to mind when looking over my analysis on Nesi&rsquo;s Notes. The first thing I wondered was whether or not Woonsocket had raised local revenues by similar amounts to other communities but had chosen to spend this money on other municipal services. Ideally, I would use a chart that showed local education revenues compared to all other local revenues over the last 15 years by city in Rhode Island.

      My analysis on Nesi&rsquo;s Notes depended entirely on the National Center for Education Statistics&rsquo; Common Core Data. The per pupil amounts reported to NCES may look a bit different from state sources of this information. There are several explanations of this. First, the enrollment counts used to generate per pupil amounts are based on an October 1st headcount. In Rhode Island, we use something called &ldquo;average daily membership&rdquo; (ADM) as the denominator and not a headcount.

Goldstein&rsquo;s second point is worth highlighting:
 Anyway, in a small school, large-scale research isn&rsquo;t the key determinant anyway. The team&rsquo;s implementation is.
 On the same day that Shanker Blog is assuring us that rigorous social science is worth it, Goldstein delivers researchers a healthy dose of humility. Rigorous research is all about doing the best we can to remove all the confounding explanatory factors that have an impact on our observed outcomes to isolate an intervention.
