      The removal of I-195 from the Jewelry District is supposed to help spur Providence&rsquo;s second renaissance by providing ample green- and brown-field development sites for a whole host of biomedical companies apparently dying to move to a state and city in fiscal crisis whose current population does not have the required skills to serve as an employment base. Seriously, I am quite optimistic about the once-in-a-generation to develop a massive part of what should be an integral part of Providence&rsquo;s downtown core 1.

      [][][/caption] I am a firm believer that some goods should be public. I do not believe that my tax dollars are about providing *direct* personal benefit. I like redistributed tax policy. But it is hard to be a Rhode Islander, surrounded by government institutions that are failing, and feel good about the taxes I pay. Corruption and cronyism is a daily reality of government business. Some agencies have tremendous waste and inefficiency.

      Have you ever tried to access public information about Providence on the web? Due to the recent, and new, requirement that residents reapply for their homestead tax exemption in Providence, I decided to poke around the Providence webpage to see what kind of public information on property was available online. I was greeted with an IT nightmare1. The system was clearly a third-party developed or purchased front end designed for searching public records on property and sold to municipalities throughout the country by winning contracts through the RFP process.

      <h1>Social Promotion, Tutoring, and Funding</h1>

      Social promotion, in education circles, refers to the practice of allowing students to move on to the next grade level or course even though they are unable to demonstrate they have mastered the skills and knowledge they were expected to learn. Ending or reducing social promotion has been a major theme in the standards-based education reform of the last 10-15 years. Ending social promotion feels like a sound, obvious consequence of standards-based education.
