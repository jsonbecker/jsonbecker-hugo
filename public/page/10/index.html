      Kevin Carey has a great new piece on his experience taking a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC). If you have any interest in blended learning, online education, and higher education policy, I would consider this a must read. He carefully addresses many of the common concerns to online only course work. Can it be truly rigorous? Yes. Do you lose the &ldquo;magic&rdquo; of taking a big lecture course in person? Maybe, but there&rsquo;s more magic in pressing pause and rewind on a video.

      Apple will be revealing new details for both of its major operating systems at WWDC on June 10, 2013. The focus of much speculation has been how Apple will improve multi-tasking and inter-app communication in iOS7. As batteries have grown, CPUs have become increasingly powerful, and the application ecosystem has matured 1, the iOS sandboxing model has felt increasingly limiting and outdated. I think that there is a simple change that could dramatically increase the effectiveness of multitasking on iOS by re-examining how application switching works.

      One thing I really dislike about Google Reader is it replaces the links to posts in my RSS feed. My Pinboard account is littered with links that start with http://feedproxy.google.com. I am quite concerned that with the demise of Google Reader on July 1, 2013, these redirects will no longer work. It&rsquo;s not just Google that obscures the actually address of links on the internet. The popularity of using link shortening services, both to save characters on Twitter and to collect analytics, has proliferated the Internet of Redirects.

      Update: Please see below for two solutions. I have grown increasingly unhappy with Wordpress lately. My blog is simple. My design tastes are simple. My needs are simple. I like control. I am a geek. And I really need an excuse to learn Python, which seems to be rapidly growing into one of the most important programming languages for a data analyst. I have decided to migrate this blog over to Pelican, a static site generator written in Python.

      <h1>A little knowledge is a wonderful (dangerous) thing</h1>

      It is so tempting to try to apply cognitive science results in education. It seems like an obvious step on the long road of moving education from a field of theory and philosophies to one more grounded in empirical research. Yet, learning myths are persistent. Even scarier, &ldquo;those who know the most about neuroscience also believe the most myths.&ldquo; Educators may have the best intentions when trying to infuse their practice with evidence, but they all too often are not equipped as critical consumers of research.
