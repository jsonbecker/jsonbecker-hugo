      A few months back I wrote some code to calculate age from a date of birth and arbitrary end date. It is not a real tricky task, but it is certainly one that comes up often when doing research on individual-level data. I was a bit surprised to only find bits and pieces of code and advice on how to best go about this task. After reading through some old R-help and Stack Overflow responses on various ways to do date math in R, this is the function I wrote 1: age_calc &lt;- function(dob, enddate=Sys.Date(), units='months'){ if (!inherits(dob, &quot;Date&quot;) | !inherits(enddate, &quot;Date&quot;)) stop(&quot;Both dob and enddate must be Date class objects&quot;) start &lt;- as.POSIXlt(dob) end &lt;- as.POSIXlt(enddate) years &lt;- end$year - start$year if(units=='years'){ result &lt;- ifelse((end$mon &lt; start$mon) | ((end$mon == start$mon) &amp; (end$mday &lt; start$mday)), years - 1, years) }else if(units=='months'){ months &lt;- (years-1) * 12 result &lt;- months + start$mon }else if(units=='days'){ result &lt;- difftime(end, start, units='days') }else{ stop(&quot;Unrecognized units.

      Kevin Carey has a great new piece on his experience taking a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC). If you have any interest in blended learning, online education, and higher education policy, I would consider this a must read. He carefully addresses many of the common concerns to online only course work. Can it be truly rigorous? Yes. Do you lose the &ldquo;magic&rdquo; of taking a big lecture course in person? Maybe, but there&rsquo;s more magic in pressing pause and rewind on a video.

      Apple will be revealing new details for both of its major operating systems at WWDC on June 10, 2013. The focus of much speculation has been how Apple will improve multi-tasking and inter-app communication in iOS7. As batteries have grown, CPUs have become increasingly powerful, and the application ecosystem has matured 1, the iOS sandboxing model has felt increasingly limiting and outdated. I think that there is a simple change that could dramatically increase the effectiveness of multitasking on iOS by re-examining how application switching works.

      One thing I really dislike about Google Reader is it replaces the links to posts in my RSS feed. My Pinboard account is littered with links that start with http://feedproxy.google.com. I am quite concerned that with the demise of Google Reader on July 1, 2013, these redirects will no longer work. It&rsquo;s not just Google that obscures the actually address of links on the internet. The popularity of using link shortening services, both to save characters on Twitter and to collect analytics, has proliferated the Internet of Redirects.

      Update: Please see below for two solutions. I have grown increasingly unhappy with Wordpress lately. My blog is simple. My design tastes are simple. My needs are simple. I like control. I am a geek. And I really need an excuse to learn Python, which seems to be rapidly growing into one of the most important programming languages for a data analyst. I have decided to migrate this blog over to Pelican, a static site generator written in Python.
