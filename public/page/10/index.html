      One of the most interesting discussions I had in class during graduate school was about how to interpret the body of evidence that existed about Teach for America. At the time, Kane, Rockoff and Staiger (KRS) had just published &ldquo;What does certification tell us about teacher effectiveness? Evidence from New York City&rdquo; in Economics of Education Review . KRS produced value-added estimates for teachers and analyzed whether their initial certification described any variance in teacher effectiveness at raising student achievement scores.

      CCSSI Mathematics posted a scathing look at the items released by the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium (SBAC). While the rest of the internet seems to be obsessed over Georgia leaving the Partnership for Assessment of College and Careers1, the real concern should be over the quality of these test items.
Although CCSSI also deligently point out questions that are not well aligned to the standards, this is the least of my worries.

      This summer has been very productive for my fiction reading backlog. Here are just some of the things I have read since Memorial Day. 1
Novels The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss I picked up The Name of the Wind on a whim while cruising through the bookstore. I was glad I did. This book tells a classic story&ndash; a precocious young wizard learns to use his powers, building toward being the most important person in the world.

      The Economic Policy Institute has release a short issue brief on the Rhode Island Retirement Security Act (RIRSA) by Robert Hiltonsmith that manages to get all of the details right but the big picture entirely wrong.
The EPI Issue Brief details the differences between the retirement system for state workers before and after the passage of RIRSA as accurately and clearly as I have ever seen. Mr. Hiltonsmith has done a notable job explaining the differences between the new system and the old system.

      A few months back I wrote some code to calculate age from a date of birth and arbitrary end date. It is not a real tricky task, but it is certainly one that comes up often when doing research on individual-level data.
I was a bit surprised to only find bits and pieces of code and advice on how to best go about this task. After reading through some old R-help and Stack Overflow responses on various ways to do date math in R, this is the function I wrote 1:
