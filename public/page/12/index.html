      Bruno is a skeptic on standards-based grading. He seems to think that &ldquo;mastery of content&rdquo; is too abstract for students to work toward and rightly cites evidence that motivation and changed behavior are tightly linked to a sense of efficacy, which in turn is tightly linked to feeling as though you know precisely what to do to get to a particular outcome. But isn&rsquo;t mastery of content essentially, &ldquo;Do well on your assignments and tests&rdquo;?

      So I have this great little custom function I&rsquo;ve used when looking at survey data in R. I call this function pull(). The goal of pull() is to quickly produce frequency tables with n sizes from individual-level survey data. Before using pull(), I create a big table that includes information about the survey questions I want to pull. The data are structured like this: quest survey year break ss01985 elementary 2011_12 schoolcode quest represents the question coding in the raw survey data.

      I like paying for good software. There are applications I use every day, some for hours a day, that make my experience on the web and on my computers better. I have paid for Reeder on three platforms, Tweetbot on two1, Pinboard, and many others. I like to pay, because I value my time, my experience, and my productivity. I also like to pay because I value my privacy. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong&ndash; I am a Google addict, using Gmail practically from the beginning, GChat, Google Calendar, Google+, Google Reader, etc, etc.

      Ted Nesi was gracious in offering me a guest spot on his blog, Nesi&rsquo;s Notes this week to discuss education funding in Woonsocket. The main conclusions of my post are: ​1. Woonsocket has not increased local funding for education over the last fifteen years despite massive increases in education expenditures in Rhode Island and nationwide. ​2. General education aid from the state has rapidly increased over the same period, demonstrating that a lack of sufficient revenue at Woonsocket Public Schools is first, if not exclusively, a local revenue problem.

      <h1>Legal Context: Can Woonsocket Successfully Sue the State for Additional Aid?</h1>

      My last post ended with an important question, &ldquo;Who is responsible for ensuring students are receiving a certain minimum quality education?&rdquo; This is my attempt at answering that question. Does the state have a legal obligation to fiscally ensure that Woonsocket students are receiving an equitable, adequate, and meaningful education? San Antonio v. Rodriquez, a landmark Supreme Court case decided in 1973 determined that there was no fundamental right to education guaranteed by the U.S.
