      I&rsquo;m mostly writing this post because I had a fairly hard time finding a resolution to a real pesky error. For some reason, my iPhone 4S was recognized by Picasa but always failed to import photos. Whenever I tried, the Picasa was clearly scanning through the files and then presented this error: An error has occurred while attempting to import. Either the source is unavailable or the destination is full or read only (1).

      I am becoming increasingly frustrated by the failure of all the major players to get social right. I have a very simple dream for how the social web should work and its baffling to me that many obvious use-cases have not been addressed at all by Facebook, Twitter, or Google. This is the first of two posts that will describe what I view as a viable framework for a social web experience.

      I am glad that Philissa Cramer is reporting on some of the deeper details of the Special Education Student Information System 1 implementation at the New York City Department of Education here. Many people don&rsquo;t really understand the ins and outs of government contracting. Folks really think NASA designs and builds the lunar module, for example, instead of realizing that they issued an RFP and contracting with Northrop Grumman to do that work for them.

      UPDATE: You should also read this page on jasonpbecker for some very strong and interesting rebuttals to Carey&rsquo;s article that I commented on below. Do read this article on Diane Ravitch. I personally have two major criticisms of Ravitch, both of which Carey exposes eloquently. First, I believe that she leverages her respect and expertise as an historian and professor to present herself as an experts in areas of academic research and policy where she has little expertise.

      <h1>Why isn&#39;t the Core Connector using Westminster with full RoW?</h1>

      I love that Providence is pursuing a streetcar. There are really just two things I don&rsquo;t understand about the Core Connector&rsquo;s proposal. I&rsquo;m going to tackle one in this post. Why is the entire streetcar route shared with general traffic with no dedicated right-of-way? Truthfully, this isn&rsquo;t a massive issue except in the core part of Downcity where there is substantial traffic during rush hours along the street car route. But this makes the plan even more perplexing because it&rsquo;s precisely this portion of the route where an obvious solution for dedicated light rail ROW exists- Westminster Street.
