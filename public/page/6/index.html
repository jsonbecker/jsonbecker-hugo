      I love that Providence is pursuing a streetcar. There are really just two things I don&rsquo;t understand about the Core Connector&rsquo;s proposal. I&rsquo;m going to tackle one in this post.
Why is the entire streetcar route shared with general traffic with no dedicated right-of-way? Truthfully, this isn&rsquo;t a massive issue except in the core part of Downcity where there is substantial traffic during rush hours along the street car route. But this makes the plan even more perplexing because it&rsquo;s precisely this portion of the route where an obvious solution for dedicated light rail ROW exists- Westminster Street.

      There are lots of things that are misleading about this story published on GoLocalProv. It is utterly ridiculous to report numbers like how many total tax dollars are being collected by different communities for the sake of comparison. You cannot compare a total number like this which is so dependent upon things like, I don&rsquo;t know, the dramatic difference in the size of these communities?
In the 2010 Census, Providence had a population of 178,042.

      I wondered to myself If I could explain these two movements in a few sentences. Is this fair?
 The Taxed Enough Already (TEA) Party movement is a response to two large government spending packages, the &ldquo;bailout&rdquo; and the &ldquo;stimulus&rdquo; package. These people felt that it was inappropriate for the government spend taxpayer money (and foreign debt) in an attempt to prevent deeper economic damage from the collapse of the real estate bubble.

      I wanted to write a lot more about this, but I just don&rsquo;t have the time.
This storyis about rezoning schools in downtown Manhattan which is struggling to meet the demands of emerging residential neighborhoods. Reading this story (and struggle) just brought up something I&rsquo;ve thought about for some time now.
The cost of school buildings is ridiculous. Schools are generally built for one purpose. They are generally built to last a very long time.

      As a resident of Downcity, I have been closely following the development of Providence&rsquo;s Core Connector Study. The official route and payment options have now been proposed, as reported in the Projo.
Route I&rsquo;m pleased to see that they prioritized frequent service through the main ridership areas (College Hill to Jewelry District and hospital) were prioritized over service to the train station. Jef Nickerson says it best over at GCPVD&ndash; the train station is out-of-the-way and would dramatically increase rider time while having unclear implications for ridership, and the station is already very well served (and could easily be better served) by existing bus routes.

      If you&rsquo;re interested in education, I highly recommend Justin Baeder&rsquo;s1 &rdquo;On Performance&rdquo; blog hosted over on Education Week.
Today, he ended his post with a question, &ldquo;I would be very interested to learn of any other sector that has achieved substantial performance gains by reforming its evaluation processes. We&rsquo;re putting a lot of eggs in the &lsquo;improve teacher evaluation to improve student learning&rsquo; basket, but no one even seems to be asking whether this strategy has any merit.

      As an undergraduate I largely avoided political science because I couldn&rsquo;t imagine getting interested in reading The Republic, Leviathan, or Wealth of Nations. Political philosophy, and philosophy in general, just seemed like a horrible painful exercise, so I avoided it. Of course now that I&rsquo;m involved in public policy and not organic chemistry, it feels as though I&rsquo;ve done a horrible disservice to myself by not going through and systematically exploring more fundamental questions about the role of the state, ethics and morality, justice, etc.

      For several years I considered switching to Apple. I&rsquo;ve been a wannabe believer since OSX. I was using Linuxas my every day operating system. This was one part about learning, one part frustration with Windows perpetual funky instabilities, and part a growing appreciation for things like the command line interface and free and open source software. OSX offered many things I liked&ndash; a great CLI I was already getting intimately familiar with, rock hard stability, beautiful graphic effects like those I enjoyed with Compiz, etc.

      Tonight, I went to a public meeting run by Providence&rsquo;s Department of Planning and Development. A few of upfront observations:
 The folks who work for the Department of Planning and Development (DPD) were professional, kind, and capable, as was the consultants who worked with them. They maintained decorum and a genuine sense of openness even though there was a clear tension in the room between some outspoken (and knowledgeable) community members and activists who had clearly participated in many past meetings.
