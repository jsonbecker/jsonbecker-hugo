      We find that public schools offered practically zero return education on the margin, yet they did enjoy significant political and financial support from local political elites, if they taught in the “right” language of instruction. One thing that both progressives and libertarians agree upon are that social goals of education are woefully underappreciated and considered in the current school reform discussion. Both school choice and local, democratic control of schools are reactions to centralization resulting in &ldquo;elites&hellip; [selecting] the &lsquo;right&rsquo; language of instruction.&rdquo; I am inclined to agree with neither.

      Update &gt; Turns out the original code below was pretty messed up. All kinds of little errors I didn&rsquo;t catch. I&rsquo;ve updated it below. There are a lot of options to refactor this further that I&rsquo;m currently considering. Sometimes it is really hard to know just how flexible something this big really should be. I think I am going to wait until I start developing tests to see where I land.

      I wanted to call attention to these interesting PISA results. Turns out that student anxiety in the United States is lower than the OECD average and belief in ability is higher 1. I thought that all of the moves in education since the start of standard&rsquo;s based reform were supposed to be generating tremendous anxiety and failing to produce students who had high sense of self-efficacy? It is also worth noting that students in the United States were more likely to skip out on school dand this had a higher than typical impact on student performance.

      Although it clocks in at 40+ pages, this is a worthwhile and relatively fast read for anyone in education policy on the future of assessment if we&rsquo;re serious about college and career readiness. There is a ton to unpack, with a fair amount it agree with and a lot I am quite a bit less sure on. I think this paper is meant for national and state level policy-makers, and so my major quibble is I think this is much more valuable for a district-level audience.

      <h1>Bilingual Education at Providence Public Schools</h1>

      “We are trying to work towards late-exit ELL programs so (students) can learn the concepts in (their) native language,” Lusi said. Administrative goals have recently shifted to a focus on proficiency in both languages because bilingual education is preferred, she added. But instituting district-wide bilingual education would require funding to hire teachers certified in both languages and to buy dual-language materials, she said. I am pretty sure this is new. I am surprised there has not been a stronger effort to pass a legislative package in Rhode Island that provides both the policy framework and funding necessary to achieve universal bilinguage education for English language learners in RI schools.
