      Apple has released the iPad Mini. Microsoft unveiled the Surface RT. Google has expanded its play with the Nexus 4 (phone) and 10 (tablet) to sandwich the previously released 7. In virtually every review of these new devices the Apple advantage was ecosystem. Time and time again, following descriptions of well designed and built hardware 1, reviewers were forced to add some form of, &ldquo;But the ecosystem cannot compete with Apple&rsquo;s 275,000 tablet-optimized application.&rdquo; I think this understates the power of Apple&rsquo;s amazing developer advantage.

      <h1>Paul Cuffee Middle School, Addressing Emotional Needs</h1>

      I like this piece in Slate on Paul Cuffee Middle School, a charter school right here in Providence. Most of what I know about child development seems to suggest that middle schools are sort of ridiculous. At the moment children are looking for role models and close relationships with adults (and not just the kids around them), we decide that kids should have many teachers, teachers should have higher loads, and the kids stay consistent while the adults change constantly.

      I have been meaning to write this post for the past couple of weeks. Like most other people, I am constantly experimenting with different ways to publish and share my thoughts and engage with social networking. Lately, I have settled into what feels like an &ldquo;end state&rdquo; workflow1. I will devote a future post to the details of how I manage my online reading, writing, and sharing workflow but for now I just wanted to let folks know where they can find me.

      I have not had the opportunity to read Paul Tough&rsquo;s newest book on &ldquo;grit&rdquo;1. I have, however, read Paul Tough&rsquo;s New York Times Magazine article on grit and recently listened to an EconTalk podcast where he discussed How Children Succeed. The thrust of Tough&rsquo;s argument, if I were to be so bold, is that there is a definable set of non-cognitive skills, called &ldquo;grit&rdquo;, that are at least as important as academic achievement in determining long-term positive outcomes for kids.

      <h1>What Can Management Do? iOS6 Maps Monday-Morning Quarterbacking</h1>

      Philip Elmer-DeWitt has suggested the iOS6 Maps debacle falls on the shoulders of Scott Forstall1. When I first read the piece, I felt like it was unfair to blame management for this kind of failure. In my experience, the Maps application is wonderful software. The turn-by-turn directions are elegant and beautiful. The vector-based maps load fast and use substantially less data. The reality is the Map app is great; the data are less so.
