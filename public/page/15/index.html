      My analysis on Nesi&rsquo;s Notes depended entirely on the National Center for Education Statistics&rsquo; Common Core Data. The per pupil amounts reported to NCES may look a bit different from state sources of this information. There are several explanations of this. First, the enrollment counts used to generate per pupil amounts are based on an October 1st headcount. In Rhode Island, we use something called &ldquo;average daily membership&rdquo; (ADM) as the denominator and not a headcount.

      Update See below for more information now that Ethan Brown has weighed in with some great code.
A recent post I came across on r-bloggers asked for input on visualizing ranked Likert-scale data.
I happen to be working on a substantial project using very similarly structured data so I thought I would share some code. In my efforts to be generic as possible, I decided to generate some fake data from scratch.

      This poignant post from Michael Goldstein ends with a few policy thoughts that largely support my previous post.
Goldstein&rsquo;s second point is worth highlighting:
 Anyway, in a small school, large-scale research isn&rsquo;t the key determinant anyway. The team&rsquo;s implementation is.
 On the same day that Shanker Blog is assuring us that rigorous social science is worth it, Goldstein delivers researchers a healthy dose of humility. Rigorous research is all about doing the best we can to remove all the confounding explanatory factors that have an impact on our observed outcomes to isolate an intervention.

      How can we tell if principal directives are fair to teachers?
There has been a great conversation circling some blogs I read over the last week about liberty in the work place.1 Issues of fairness in the work place are a constant in today&rsquo;s education conversation. Whether some view it as a form of metaphoric violence on teachers and their profession, while others see a concerted effort to change rigid, bureaucratic systems that prevent effective change2, at the heart of education reform du jour are changes to workplace freedom.

      Tonight I started Coursera.org&rsquo;s Algorithms: Design and Analysis Part I. This class should pick up right about where I left off my computer science education. I took CS15 as a sophomore in college but didn&rsquo;t have the time to take CS16: Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures. So, while it&rsquo;s been almost 6 years since I have formally taken a computer science class, it is time to continue my education.
