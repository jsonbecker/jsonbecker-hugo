      <h1>Bank of America will leave 111 Westminster</h1>

      I was pretty disappointed, but not surprised, that Bank of America has chosen to leave 111 Westminster Street. The building is an iconic anchor to downtown Providence. Unfortunately, this space has not been properly refurbished to more modern standards. The entire building has a single, antiquated utilities system&ndash; heating, cooling, electricity, etc are all setup for a single tenant. Weighing in at 350,000 square feet, there is simply no one in Providence who needs an old, out of date workspace of that size.

      <h1>Providence Pensions-- Let&#39;s Call a Spade a Spade (or the COLA a Raise)</h1>

      Ted Nesi has done a pretty solid job tracing the history of some awful decisions made by union-dominated boards that resulted in a significant number of retirees in the early-90s receiving 5% or 6% annually compounded interest on their retirement income. These are often called COLAs, or cost-of-living adjustments. Today, I am inspired by Nesi&rsquo;s post on the rapid decline of the Providence municipal pension fund health that occurred since 6% &ldquo;COLA&rdquo; was introduced in 1989 through today.

      The past few months I&rsquo;ve been learning how to use R. This morning, I decided to try out two first&ndash; importing a table of data that is being read of the web and overlaying location data onto a map. With a little bit of Google skills and just enough R know-how I was able to produce this image: There were a few things that were kind of tricky for me. First, for sometime I couldn&rsquo;t get latitude and longitude components for the addresses.

      <h1>What if the technology revolution in schools is really about the simple stuff?</h1>

      The complicated school day is essentially designed so the minimum number of staff are away from kids at any given time. Some folks are trying to combat this with common planning time and other scheduling gymnastics. These attempts are up against a strong opposing priority&ndash; students must be with an adult essentially 100% of the time. Not only that, but the middle of a hectic day focused on teaching is not really conducive to reflection, strategizing, and deep planning on a tight schedule.
