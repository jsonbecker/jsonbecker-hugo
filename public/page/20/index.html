      As an undergraduate I largely avoided political science because I couldn&rsquo;t imagine getting interested in reading The Republic, Leviathan, or Wealth of Nations. Political philosophy, and philosophy in general, just seemed like a horrible painful exercise, so I avoided it. Of course now that I&rsquo;m involved in public policy and not organic chemistry, it feels as though I&rsquo;ve done a horrible disservice to myself by not going through and systematically exploring more fundamental questions about the role of the state, ethics and morality, justice, etc.

      For several years I considered switching to Apple. I&rsquo;ve been a wannabe believer since OSX. I was using Linuxas my every day operating system. This was one part about learning, one part frustration with Windows perpetual funkyÂ instabilities, and part a growing appreciation for things like the command line interface and free and open source software. OSX offered many things I liked&ndash; a great CLI I was already getting intimately familiar with, rock hard stability, beautiful graphic effects like those I enjoyed with Compiz, etc.

      Tonight, I went to a public meeting run by Providence&rsquo;s Department of Planning and Development. A few of upfront observations:
 The folks who work for the Department of Planning and Development (DPD) were professional, kind, and capable, as was the consultants who worked with them. They maintained decorum and a genuine sense of openness even though there was a clear tension in the room between some outspoken (and knowledgeable) community members and activists who had clearly participated in many past meetings.
