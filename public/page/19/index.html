      UPDATE: You should also read this page on jasonpbecker for some very strong and interesting rebuttals to Carey&rsquo;s article that I commented on below.
Do read this article on Diane Ravitch. I personally have two major criticisms of Ravitch, both of which Carey exposes eloquently.
First, I believe that she leverages her respect and expertise as an historian and professor to present herself as an experts in areas of academic research and policy where she has little expertise.

      I love that Providence is pursuing a streetcar. There are really just two things I don&rsquo;t understand about the Core Connector&rsquo;s proposal. I&rsquo;m going to tackle one in this post.
Why is the entire streetcar route shared with general traffic with no dedicated right-of-way? Truthfully, this isn&rsquo;t a massive issue except in the core part of Downcity where there is substantial traffic during rush hours along the street car route. But this makes the plan even more perplexing because it&rsquo;s precisely this portion of the route where an obvious solution for dedicated light rail ROW exists- Westminster Street.

      There are lots of things that are misleading about this story published on GoLocalProv. It is utterly ridiculous to report numbers like how many total tax dollars are being collected by different communities for the sake of comparison. You cannot compare a total number like this which is so dependent upon things like, I don&rsquo;t know, the dramatic difference in the size of these communities?
In the 2010 Census, Providence had a population of 178,042.

      I wondered to myself If I could explain these two movements in a few sentences. Is this fair?
 The Taxed Enough Already (TEA) Party movement is a response to two large government spending packages, the &ldquo;bailout&rdquo; and the &ldquo;stimulus&rdquo; package. These people felt that it was inappropriate for the government spend taxpayer money (and foreign debt) in an attempt to prevent deeper economic damage from the collapse of the real estate bubble.

      I wanted to write a lot more about this, but I just don&rsquo;t have the time.
This storyis about rezoning schools in downtown Manhattan which is struggling to meet the demands of emerging residential neighborhoods. Reading this story (and struggle) just brought up something I&rsquo;ve thought about for some time now.
The cost of school buildings is ridiculous. Schools are generally built for one purpose. They are generally built to last a very long time.
