      I wondered to myself If I could explain these two movements in a few sentences. Is this fair?
 The Taxed Enough Already (TEA) Party movement is a response to two large government spending packages, the &ldquo;bailout&rdquo; and the &ldquo;stimulus&rdquo; package. These people felt that it was inappropriate for the government spend taxpayer money (and foreign debt) in an attempt to prevent deeper economic damage from the collapse of the real estate bubble.

      I wanted to write a lot more about this, but I just don&rsquo;t have the time.
This storyis about rezoning schools in downtown Manhattan which is struggling to meet the demands of emerging residential neighborhoods. Reading this story (and struggle) just brought up something I&rsquo;ve thought about for some time now.
The cost of school buildings is ridiculous. Schools are generally built for one purpose. They are generally built to last a very long time.

      <h1>Downcity Residents Should Support the Core Connector and the Tax Makes Sense</h1>

      As a resident of Downcity, I have been closely following the development of Providence&rsquo;s Core Connector Study. The official route and payment options have now been proposed, as reported in the Projo.
Route I&rsquo;m pleased to see that they prioritized frequent service through the main ridership areas (College Hill to Jewelry District and hospital) were prioritized over service to the train station. Jef Nickerson says it best over at GCPVD&ndash; the train station is out-of-the-way and would dramatically increase rider time while having unclear implications for ridership, and the station is already very well served (and could easily be better served) by existing bus routes.

      If you&rsquo;re interested in education, I highly recommend Justin Baeder&rsquo;s1 &rdquo;On Performance&rdquo; blog hosted over on Education Week.
Today, he ended his post with a question, &ldquo;I would be very interested to learn of any other sector that has achieved substantial performance gains by reforming its evaluation processes. We&rsquo;re putting a lot of eggs in the &lsquo;improve teacher evaluation to improve student learning&rsquo; basket, but no one even seems to be asking whether this strategy has any merit.

      As an undergraduate I largely avoided political science because I couldn&rsquo;t imagine getting interested in reading The Republic, Leviathan, or Wealth of Nations. Political philosophy, and philosophy in general, just seemed like a horrible painful exercise, so I avoided it. Of course now that I&rsquo;m involved in public policy and not organic chemistry, it feels as though I&rsquo;ve done a horrible disservice to myself by not going through and systematically exploring more fundamental questions about the role of the state, ethics and morality, justice, etc.
