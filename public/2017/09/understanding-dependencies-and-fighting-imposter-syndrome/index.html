<h2 id="what-is-this-post-project">What is this post/project?</h2>

<p>This is the first in what I hope will be a series of blog posts tackling imposter syndrome.</p>

<p>After 6 years of writing R code, I still lack confidence reading the source of many of the packages that I rely on. At least part of this is a total lack of experience with C++, an increasingly important part of writing performant R packages. But I think mostly I just don&rsquo;t make the time to dive deep. I am intimidated, and the code I write works for what I need to accomplish.</p>

<p>The last three years I have been writing my own R packages internally at <a href="http://www.allovue.com">Allovue</a>. This experience has made me a much better R programmer and a better software developer in general. I can still remember feeling like writing more than a series of hacky scripts felt daunting, yet here I am writing my own packages that make me proud.</p>

<p>So I decided to embark on a project. I am going to fight my imposter syndrome, and hopefully yours, by going through a key package and making sense of it in public. I will be exposing <em>how</em> I read R code, which I bet will help some beginners tackle larger code bases than they are used to working with. I will expose what I need to learn, and how I go about learning it. Hopefully, the process will help me learn how to be a better reader of R code and how to be a part of larger open source projects and take a few readers along with me.</p>

<h2 id="package-choice">Package Choice</h2>

<p>I may change what package I choose to use for this series of posts. But for now, I&rsquo;ve chosen <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/dbplyr"><code>dbplyr</code></a>. I thought this was a good candidate package because:</p>

<ol>
<li>I use <code>tidyverse</code> packages every day.</li>
<li>I use databases every day, and write as much SQL as R. I feel like I understand most of the background for the problem space that <code>dbplyr</code> seeks to address.</li>
<li><code>dplyr</code> and <code>tidyr</code> feel overly intimidating, versus a component to make those packages work with databases. I may find this is a deep error which pushes me more into <code>dplyr</code> internals. This will either be a happy accident or drive me somewhere else.</li>
</ol>
