      <p>You can check my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5380958-jason">Goodreads profile</a>. I love science fiction and fantasy. And I know in 2017 and everyone has already observed the dominance of &ldquo;geek culture&rdquo;, with the dominance of Disney properties from Marvel and now Star Wars. Hell, <a href="http://io9.gizmodo.com/suicide-squad-is-now-an-oscar-winning-movie-1792769922">Suicide Squad won a goddamn Oscar</a>.</p>

<p>But I never felt like SFF was all that mainstream. SyFy might have made (and renewed) a TV series based on <em>The Magicians</em>, but I still feel like the disaffected entitled shit that held onto his love of genre fiction too long when I crawl into bed and hide in speculative fiction (thank you Quentin, for so completely capturing what a shit I was at 14).</p>

<p>Yesterday, I was confronted with the reality of SFF going mainstream at <a href="http://www.powells.com">Powell&rsquo;s City of Books</a>. I was fully unprepared to see the contents of their Best Selling Fiction shelf.</p>

<p>By my count, at least 16 of the top 42 are SFF. <em>The Name of the Wind</em>, <em>The Left Hand of Darkness</em>, <em>The Fifth Season</em>, <em>2312</em>, and <em>Uprooted</em> are some of the best books I&rsquo;ve ready in the last four or five years. To think of these books as best sellers when they don&rsquo;t have a TV show coming out (like <em>American Gods</em>, <em>The Handmaid&rsquo;s Tale</em>, <em>The Man in the High Castle</em>, and <em>The Magicians</em>) and aren&rsquo;t assigned in high school classrooms (<em>1984</em>, <em>Slaughterhouse-Five</em>) is just shocking. In my mind, these aren&rsquo;t best sellers, they&rsquo;re tiny nods between myself and other quiet bookshoppers that we are kin.</p>

<p>I am not sad though. I am thrilled. I want to live in a world where I can just assume acquaintances are reading <em>The Fifth Season</em> and <em>Uprooted</em>.</p>
