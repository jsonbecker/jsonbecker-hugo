      <description>I read a lot of science fiction and fantasy, genres filled with long running book series. Until the last couple of years, I mostly avoided any series that wasn&amp;rsquo;t already complete. First, I don&amp;rsquo;t like truly “epic” sci-fi fantasy. On-going series without an end in sight, or series that go beyond roughly 3,000 to 4,000 pages never end well for me1. I simply lose interest. Second, I worry that series won&amp;rsquo;t actually reach completion, either because the books are not successful enough or the author gets writer&amp;rsquo;s block2, or even just getting caught up in waiting way too long between books3.</description>
