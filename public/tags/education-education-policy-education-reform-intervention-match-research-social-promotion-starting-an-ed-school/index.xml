      <description>This poignant post from Michael GoldsteinÂ ends with a few policy thoughts that largely support my previous post.
Goldstein&amp;rsquo;s second point is worth highlighting:
 Anyway, in a small school, large-scale research isn&amp;rsquo;t the key determinant anyway. The team&amp;rsquo;s implementation is.
 On the same day that Shanker Blog is assuring us that rigorous social science is worth it, Goldstein delivers researchers a healthy dose of humility. Rigorous research is all about doing the best we can to remove all the confounding explanatory factors that have an impact on our observed outcomes to isolate an intervention.</description>
