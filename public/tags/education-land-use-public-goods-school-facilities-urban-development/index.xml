      <description>I wanted to write a lot more about this, but I just don&amp;rsquo;t have the time.
This storyis about rezoning schools in downtown Manhattan which is struggling to meet the demands of emerging residential neighborhoods. Reading this story (and struggle) just brought up something I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about for some time now.
The cost of school buildings is ridiculous. Schools are generally built for one purpose. They are generally built to last a very long time.</description>
