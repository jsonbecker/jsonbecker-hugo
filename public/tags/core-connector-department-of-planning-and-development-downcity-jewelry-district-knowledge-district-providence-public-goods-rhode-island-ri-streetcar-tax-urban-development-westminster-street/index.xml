I am a firm believer that some goods should be public. I do not believe that my tax dollars are about providing *direct* personal benefit. I like redistributed tax policy. But it is hard to be a Rhode Islander, surrounded by government institutions that are failing, and feel good about the taxes I pay. Corruption and cronyism is a daily reality of government business. Some agencies have tremendous waste and inefficiency.</description>
