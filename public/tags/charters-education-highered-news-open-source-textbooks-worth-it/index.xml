      <description>I read literally hundreds of posts from RSS feeds every day. I use Google Reader as an aggregator, Reeder to actually read through my feeds, and Pinboard for social bookmarking and posting1.
In order to capture just a small slice of the stories I really enjoyed, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to start a new feature called &amp;ldquo;Worth It&amp;rdquo;. I hope this will be between 3 and 5 stories each week with some quick commentary that I think are worth anyone&amp;rsquo;s time to read.</description>
