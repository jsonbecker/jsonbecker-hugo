      <description>My Democracy Prep colleague Lindsay Malanga and I often say we should start an organization called the Coalition of Pretty Good Schools. We&amp;rsquo;d start with the following principles.
 Every child must have a safe, warm, disruption-free classroom as a non-negotiable, fundamental right. All children should be taught to read using phonics-based instruction. All children must master basic computational skills with automaticity before moving on to higher mathematics. Every child must be given a well-rounded education that includes science, civics, history, geography, music, the arts, and physical education.</description>
