      <description>I wondered to myself If I could explain these two movements in a few sentences. Is this fair?
 The Taxed Enough Already (TEA) Party movement is a response to two large government spending packages, the &amp;ldquo;bailout&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;stimulus&amp;rdquo; package. These people felt that it was inappropriate for the government spend taxpayer money (and foreign debt) in an attempt to prevent deeper economic damage from the collapse of the real estate bubble.</description>
