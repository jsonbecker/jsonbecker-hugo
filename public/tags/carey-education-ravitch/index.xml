      <description>UPDATE: You should also read this page on jasonpbecker for some very strong and interesting rebuttals to Carey&amp;rsquo;s article that I commented on below.
Do read this article on Diane Ravitch. I personally have two major criticisms of Ravitch, both of which Carey exposes eloquently.
First, I believe that she leverages her respect and expertise as an historian and professor to present herself as an experts in areas of academic research and policy where she has little expertise.</description>
