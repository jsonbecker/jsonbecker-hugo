      <description>CCSSI Mathematics posted a scathing look at the items released by the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium (SBAC). While the rest of the internet seems to be obsessed over Georgia leaving the Partnership for Assessment of College and Careers1, the real concern should be over the quality of these test items.
Although CCSSI also deligently point out questions that are not well aligned to the standards, this is the least of my worries.</description>
