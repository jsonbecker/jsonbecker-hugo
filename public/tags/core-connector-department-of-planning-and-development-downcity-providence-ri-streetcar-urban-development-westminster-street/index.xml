      <description>I love that Providence is pursuing a streetcar. There are really just two things I don&amp;rsquo;t understand about the Core Connector&amp;rsquo;s proposal. I&amp;rsquo;m going to tackle one in this post.
Why is the entire streetcar route shared with general traffic with no dedicated right-of-way? Truthfully, this isn&amp;rsquo;t a massive issue except in the core part of Downcity where there is substantial traffic during rush hours along the street car route. But this makes the plan even more perplexing because it&amp;rsquo;s precisely this portion of the route where an obvious solution for dedicated light rail ROW exists- Westminster Street.</description>
