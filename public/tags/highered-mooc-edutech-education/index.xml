      <description>Kevin Carey has a great new piece on his experience taking a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC). If you have any interest in blended learning, online education, and higher education policy, I would consider this a must read.
He carefully addresses many of the common concerns to online only course work. Can it be truly rigorous? Yes. Do you lose the &amp;ldquo;magic&amp;rdquo; of taking a big lecture course in person?</description>
