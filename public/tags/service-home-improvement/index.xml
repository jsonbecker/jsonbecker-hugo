      <description>A few thoughts:
 This is a very interesting way to take advantage of a number of existing Amazon technologies&amp;ndash;primarily their payment processing and review system. Services are an increasingly important part of the economy and is less subject to commoditization. This is Amazon dipping into a massive growth area by commoditizing discovery and payment. It also offloads some of the risk from both sides of the transaction. It&amp;rsquo;s very bold, possibly brilliant.</description>
