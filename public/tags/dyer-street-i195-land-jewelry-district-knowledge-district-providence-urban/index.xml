      <description>The removal of I-195 from the Jewelry District is supposed to help spur Providence&amp;rsquo;s second renaissance by providing ample green- and brown-field development sites for a whole host of biomedical companies apparently dying to move to a state and city in fiscal crisis whose current population does not have the required skills to serve as an employment base.
Seriously, I am quite optimistic about the once-in-a-generation to develop a massive part of what should beÂ an integral part of Providence&amp;rsquo;s downtown core 1.</description>
