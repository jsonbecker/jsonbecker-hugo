      <description>I have not had the opportunity to read Paul Tough&amp;rsquo;s newest book on &amp;ldquo;grit&amp;rdquo;1. I have, however, read Paul Tough&amp;rsquo;s New York Times Magazine article on grit and recently listened to an EconTalk podcast where he discussed How Children Succeed.
The thrust of Tough&amp;rsquo;s argument, if I were to be so bold, is that there is a definable set of non-cognitive skills, called &amp;ldquo;grit&amp;rdquo;, that are at least as important as academic achievement in determining long-term positive outcomes for kids.</description>
