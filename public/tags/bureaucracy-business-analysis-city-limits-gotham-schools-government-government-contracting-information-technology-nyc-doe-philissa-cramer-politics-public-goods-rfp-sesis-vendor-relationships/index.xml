      <description>I am glad that Philissa Cramer is reporting on some of the deeper details of the Special Education Student Information System 1Â implementation at the New York City Department of Education here. Many people don&amp;rsquo;t really understand the ins and outs of government contracting. Folks really think NASA designs and builds the lunar module, for example, instead of realizing that they issued an RFP and contracting with Northrop Grumman to do that work for them.</description>
