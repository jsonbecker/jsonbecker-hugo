      <description>Although it clocks in at 40+ pages, this is a worthwhile and relatively fast read for anyone in education policy on the future of assessment if we&amp;rsquo;re serious about college and career readiness. There is a ton to unpack, with a fair amount it agree with and a lot I am quite a bit less sure on.
I think this paper is meant for national and state level policy-makers, and so my major quibble is I think this is much more valuable for a district-level audience.</description>
