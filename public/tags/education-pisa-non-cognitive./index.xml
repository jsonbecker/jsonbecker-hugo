      <description>I wanted to call attention to these interesting PISA results. Turns out that student anxiety in the United States is lower than the OECD average and belief in ability is higher 1. I thought that all of the moves in education since the start of standard&amp;rsquo;s based reform were supposed to be generating tremendous anxiety and failing to produce students who had high sense of self-efficacy?
It is also worth noting that students in the United States were more likely to skip out on school dand this had a higher than typical impact on student performance.</description>
