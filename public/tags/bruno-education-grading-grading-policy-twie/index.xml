      <description>Bruno is a skeptic on standards-based grading. HeÂ seems to think that &amp;ldquo;mastery of content&amp;rdquo; is too abstract for students to work toward and rightly cites evidence that motivation and changed behavior are tightly linked to a sense of efficacy, which in turn is tightly linked to feeling as though you know precisely what to do to get to a particular outcome.
But isn&amp;rsquo;t mastery of content essentially, &amp;ldquo;Do well on your assignments and tests&amp;rdquo;?</description>
