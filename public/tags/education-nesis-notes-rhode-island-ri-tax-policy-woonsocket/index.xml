      <description>Ted Nesi was gracious in offering me a guest spot on his blog, Nesi&amp;rsquo;s Notes this week to discuss education funding in Woonsocket. The main conclusions of my post are:
​1. Woonsocket has not increased local funding for education over the last fifteen years despite massive increases in education expenditures in Rhode Island and nationwide.
​2. General education aid from the state has rapidly increased over the same period, demonstrating that a lack of sufficient revenue at Woonsocket Public Schools is first, if not exclusively, a local revenue problem.</description>
