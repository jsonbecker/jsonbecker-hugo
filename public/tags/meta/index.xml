      <description>I have had a Tumblr site for a long time but never knew what to do with it. What is Tumblr exactly? Is it a hosted blog? Is it a hosted blog for hipsters? Is it a social network? Why should I put content into Tumblr?
I have this blog, but I barely use it. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a Facebook page, because I don&amp;rsquo;t trust Facebook and how it repeatedly changed and confused privacy settings and after college, I rarely found that Facebook was a net positive in my life.</description>
