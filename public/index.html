      <p>I have been using <code>ggplot2</code> for 7 years I think. In all that time, I&rsquo;ve been frustrated that I can never figure out what order to put my color values in for <code>scale_*_manual</code>. Not only is the order mapping seemingly random to me, I know that sometimes if I change something about how I&rsquo;m treating the data, the order switches up.</p>

<p>Countless hours could have been saved if I knew that this one, in hindsight, obvious thing was possible.</p>

<p>Whenever using <code>scale_*_manual</code>, you can directly reference a color using a character vector and then name your <code>value</code> in the <code>scale_</code> call like so:</p>

<pre><code class="language-r">geom_blah(aes(color = 'good')) +
geom_blah(aes(color = 'bad')) +
scale_blah_manual(values = c(good = 'green', bad = 'red'))
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously this is a toy example, but holy game changer.</p>

      Looking back on 2017, there were three major trends in my R code: the end of S4, directly writing to SQL database, and purrr everywhere.
The End of S4 The first package I ever wrote extensively used S4 classes. I wanted to have the security of things like setValidity. I liked the idea of calling new as it felt more like class systems I was familiar with from that one semester of Java in college.

      My latest project at work involves (surprise!) an R package that interacts with a database. For the most part, that&rsquo;s nothing new for me. Almost all the work I&rsquo;ve done in R in the last 7 years has interacted with databases in some way. What was new for this project is that the database would not be remote, but instead would be running alongside my code in a linked Docker container.

      I have not yet spent the time to figure out how to generate a JSON feed in Hugo yet. But I have built an R package to play with JSON feeds. It&rsquo;s called jsonfeedr, and it&rsquo;s silly simple.
Maybe I&rsquo;ll extend this in the future. I hope people will submit PRs to expand it. For now, I was inspired by all the talk about why JSON feed even exists. Working with JSON is fun and easy.

      Sometimes, silly small things about code I write just delight me. There are lots of ways to time things in R. 1 Tools like microbenchmark are great for profiling code, but what I do all the time is log how long database queries that are scheduled to run each night are taking.
It is really easy to use calls to Sys.time and difftime when working interactively, but I didn&rsquo;t want to pepper all of my code with the same log statements all over the place.

      Non-standard evaluation is one of R&rsquo;s best features, and also one of it&rsquo;s most perplexing. Recently I have been making good use of wrapr::let to allow me to write reusable functions without a lot of assumptions about my data. For example, let&rsquo;s say I always want to group_by schools when adding up dollars spent, but that sometimes my data calls what is conceptually a school schools, school, location, cost_center, Loc.
