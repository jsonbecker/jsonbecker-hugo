      Ideation At the start of every project, there&rsquo;s a blinking cursor.
Actually, that&rsquo;s almost never true for me. If I start staring at a blinking cursor, I&rsquo;m almost guaranteed to keep looking at a blinking cursor, often for hours. The real work almost always starts weeks or months before I actually type anything. I think it&rsquo;s easy for folks for whom their ultimate product is a bunch of code or an analysis report to undervalue that our work is creative.

      I have some text, but I want the content of that text to be dynamic based on data. This is a case for string interpolation. Lots of languages have the ability to write something like
pet = &quot;dog&quot; puts &quot;This is my {#pet}&quot;  pet = &quot;dog&quot; print(f&quot;This is my {pet}&quot;)  There have been ways to do this in R, but I&rsquo;ve mostly hated them until glue came along. Using glue in R should look really familiar now:

Almost all the work I&rsquo;ve done in R in the last 7 years has interacted with databases in some way. What was new for this project is that the database would not be remote, but instead would be running alongside my code in a linked Docker container.

Maybe I&rsquo;ll extend this in the future. I hope people will submit PRs to expand it. For now, I was inspired by all the talk about why JSON feed even exists. Working with JSON is fun and easy.

      Non-standard evaluation is one of R&rsquo;s best features, and also one of it&rsquo;s most perplexing.

For example, let&rsquo;s say I always want to group_by schools when adding up dollars spent, but that sometimes my data calls what is conceptually a school schools, school, location, cost_center, Loc.

      A lot of the data I work with uses numeric codes rather than text to describe features of each record. For example, financial data often has a fund code that represents the account&rsquo;s source of dollars and an object code that signals what is bought (e.g. salaries, benefits, supplies). This is a little like the factor data type in R, which to the frustration of many modern analysts is internally an integer that mapped to a character label (which is a level) with a fixed number of possible values.

      I read a lot of science fiction and fantasy, genres filled with long running book series. Until the last couple of years, I mostly avoided any series that wasn&rsquo;t already complete. First, I don&rsquo;t like truly “epic” sci-fi fantasy. On-going series without an end in sight, or series that go beyond roughly 3,000 to 4,000 pages never end well for me1. I simply lose interest. Second, I worry that series won&rsquo;t actually reach completion, either because the books are not successful enough or the author gets writer&rsquo;s block2, or even just getting caught up in waiting way too long between books3.

      I have had a Tumblr site for a long time but never knew what to do with it. What is Tumblr exactly? Is it a hosted blog? Is it a hosted blog for hipsters? Is it a social network? Why should I put content into Tumblr?
I have this blog, but I barely use it. I don&rsquo;t have a Facebook page, because I don&rsquo;t trust Facebook and how it repeatedly changed and confused privacy settings and after college, I rarely found that Facebook was a net positive in my life.
