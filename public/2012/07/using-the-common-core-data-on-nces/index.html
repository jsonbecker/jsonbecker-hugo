    <div class = 'col-12'>
      <p>My analysis on <a href="http://blogs.wpri.com/?p=62059">Nesi&rsquo;s Notes</a> depended entirely on the <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/ccd/bat">National Center for Education Statistics&rsquo; Common Core Data</a>. The per pupil amounts reported to NCES may look a bit different from state sources of this information. There are several explanations of this. First, the enrollment counts used to generate per pupil amounts are based on an October 1st headcount. In Rhode Island, we use something called &ldquo;average daily membership&rdquo; (ADM) as the denominator and not a headcount. The ADM of a district is calculated by taking all the students who attended the district at any point in the year and adding up the number of school days they were enrolled for. The total membership (i.e. all the student*days, for those who like to think about this in units) is divided by the number of school days per year, almost always 180 (so student*days / days/year = students/year). Additionally, NCES does not record the final three digits on most financial data. These rounding issues will also make the per pupil data seem different from state reports.</p>

<p>I wanted to use the NCES to make sure that the data in my post was easily reproducible by any member of the public. I also thought using NCES would serve as a great learning opportunity for the wonks and nerds out there who never even realized how much rich data about schools and school finance are available through the federal government. That being said, I do believe that the state reported numbers are far more accurate than those available from the federal government. That is not to say that the federal data is bad. On the contrary, that data is substantially vetted and validated and is very useful for research. My concern was only that some of the tiny differences in the NCES data that deviated from what I would consider to be ideal data might reach the level where they affected the validity of the conclusions I wanted to draw.</p>

<p>Although I was writing as a private citizen without the support of the Rhode Island Department of Education, I did use my access to RIDE data to ensure that differences in the federal reports were not significant enough to call into question my analysis. I found that both the direction and magnitude of all the trends that I describe in the Nesi&rsquo;s Notes post held up with the state data. While all of that information is publicly available, it is less easily accessible than NCES data and doesn&rsquo;t provide the same opportunity for analysis outside of financial data. For these reasons, I decided to stick with NCES.</p>

<p>So how do you reproduce the data I used?</p>

<p>First, go to  the <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/ccd/bat">NCES Common Core Data Build a Table</a> site. On the drop down, select &ldquo;District&rdquo; as the row variable and select the last fifteen years excluding 2009-10 (since there is no current financial data available for that year).</p>

<p><img src="/img/nces1.png" alt="1" /></p>

<p>After clicking next, hit &ldquo;I Agree&rdquo; on the pop-up.</p>

<p><img src="/img/nces2.png" alt="2" /></p>

<p>Now select &ldquo;Finance Per Pupil Ratios&rdquo; for the first column.</p>

<p><img src="/img/nces3.png" alt="3" /></p>

<p>Click the green arrow that selects all years for local sources per
student and state sources per student.</p>

<p><img src="/img/nces4.png" alt="4" /></p>

<p>Click &ldquo;Next&gt;&gt;&rdquo; on the top right. Now select only RI-Rhode Island for
your row variable.</p>

<p><img src="/img/nces5.png" alt="5" /></p>

<p>Finally, click view table to see the results. I recommend downloading
the Test (.csv) file to work with.</p>

<p><img src="/img/nces6.png" alt="6" /></p>

<p>And finally, here&rsquo;s the R code to reshape/rejigger the data I used and
produce the graphics from the Nesi&rsquo;s Notes post.</p>
