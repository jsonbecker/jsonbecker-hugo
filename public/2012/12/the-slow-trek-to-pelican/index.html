<p><em>Update: Please see below for two solutions.</em></p>

<p>I have grown increasingly unhappy with Wordpress lately. My blog is simple. My design tastes are simple. My needs are simple. I like control. I am a geek. And I really need an excuse to learn Python, which seems to be rapidly growing into one of the most important programming languages for a data analyst.</p>

<p>I have decided to migrate this blog over to <a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.1.1/">Pelican</a>, a static site generator written in Python. Static sites are the &ldquo;classic&rdquo; way to do a webpage&ndash; just upload a bunch of HTML and CSS files, maybe some Javascript. But no databases and no constructing the page a user sees in the browser as they request it. This puts substantially less strain on a web server and makes it far easier to export and move a webpage since all you need to do is duplicate files. What makes static sites a real pain is that there is a lot of repetition. Folks adopted dynamic sites that use content management system so that they can write a page called &ldquo;post.php&rdquo; one time, and for each unique post just query a database for the unique content. The frame around the post, layout, components, etc are all just written once. Static site generators allow you to build a webpage using a similar, but far more stripped down, layout system. However, rather than generate each page on the web server, you generate each page by running a script locally that transforms plain text documents into well-formed HTML/CSS. Then you can just upload a directory and the whole site is ready to go.</p>

<p>Pelican comes with a pretty good script that will take Wordpress XML that&rsquo;s available via the built-in export tools and transform each post into a <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html">reStructuredText</a> files, a format similar to <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>. I prefer Markdown so I used <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">pandoc</a> to convert all my *.rst posts into *.md files.</p>

<p>So far, so good.</p>

<p>But one of the really big problems I had with Wordpress was a growing dependency on plugins that added non-standard, text-based markup in my posts that would be rendered a particular way. For example, text surrounded by two parenthesis, &lsquo;[^0]&lsquo;, became a footnote. For code syntax highlighting, I use a &ldquo;short code&rdquo;, which puts &ldquo;sourcecode language=&lsquo;r&rsquo;&rdquo;, for example, between brackets []. All of these plugins have been great, but now when you try to export a post you get the non-standard markup in-line as part of your posts. It makes it very difficult to recreate a post the way it looks today.</p>

<p>This presents a great opportunity to learn a little Python. So I have begun to scrounge together some basic Python knowledge to write some scripts to clean up my Markdown files and convert the syntax of the short codes that I have used to properly formatted Markdown so that when I run the pelican script it will accurately reproduce each post.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I&rsquo;ve hit a snag with my very first attempt. Footnotes are a big deal to me and have standard Markdown interpretation. In Markdown, footnotes are inserted in the text where &ldquo;[\^#]&rdquo; appears in the text, where # = the footnote identifier/key. Then, at the end of the document, surrounded by new lines, the footnote text is found with &ldquo;[\^#]: footnote text&rdquo; where # is the same identifier. So I needed to write a script that found each instance of text surrounded by two parentheses, insert the [\^#] part in place of the footnote, and then add the footnote at the bottom of the post in the right format.</p>

<p>I created a test text file:</p>

<pre><code>:::
This is a test ((test footnote)).
And here is another test ((footnote2)). Why not add a third? ((Three
Three)).
</code></pre>

<p>The goal was to end up with a file like this:</p>

<pre><code>:::
This is a test [^1]. And here is another
test [^2]. Why not add a third? [^3].

[^1]: test footnote

[^2]: footnote2

[^3]: Three Three
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, the output isn&rsquo;t quite right. My best attempt resulted in
a file like this:</p>

<pre><code>:::
This is a test [^1] And here is another te[^2])). Why not add a
t[^3]ree)).

[^1]: ((test footnote))

[^2]: ((footnote2))

[^3]: ((Three Three))
</code></pre>

<p>Ugh.</p>

<p>So I am turning to the tiny slice of my readership that might actually know Python or just code in general to help me out. Where did I screw up? The source to my Python script is below so feel free to comment here or on this <a href="https://gist.github.com/4342554#file-wpfootnotestomarkdown-py">Gist</a>. I am particularly frustrate that the regex appears to be capturing the parenthesis, because that&rsquo;s not how the same code behaves on <a href="http://www.pythonregex.com">PythonRegex.com</a>.</p>

<p>If anyone can help me with the next step, which will be creating arguments that will understand an input like *.rst and set the output to creating a file that&rsquo;s *.md, that would be appreciated as well.</p>

<pre><code>:::python
import re

p = re.compile(&quot;\(\(([^\(\(\)\)]+)\)\)&quot;)
file_path = str(raw_input('File Name &gt;'))
text = open(file_path).read()

footnoteMatches = p.finditer(text)

coordinates = []
footnotes = []

# Print span of matches
for match in footnoteMatches:
    coordinates.append(match.span())
    footnotes.append(match.group())

for i in range(0,len(coordinates)):
    text = (text[0:coordinates[i][0]] + '[^' + str(i+1)+ ']' +
            text[coordinates[i][1]+1:])
    shift = coordinates[i][1] - coordinates[i][0]
    j = i + 1
    while j &lt; len(coordinates):
        coordinates[j] = (coordinates[j][0] - shift, coordinates[j][1] - shift)
        j += 1

referenceLinkList = [text 1=&quot;'
'&quot; language=&quot;,&quot;][/text]
for i in range(0, len(footnotes)):
    insertList = ''.join(['\n', '[^', str(i+1), ']: ', footnotes[i], '\n'])
    referenceLinkList.append(insertList)

text = ''.join(referenceLinkList)

newFile = open(file_path, 'w')
newFile.truncate()
newFile.write(text)
newFile.close()
</code></pre>

<h2 id="update-with-solutions">Update with solutions:</h2>

<p>I am happy to report I now have two working solutions. The first one comes courtesy of <a href="https://github.com/ilikepi">James Blanding</a> who was kind enough to <a href="https://gist.github.com/4355865">fork</a> the gist I put up. While I was hoping to take a look tonight at his fork tonight, <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4957935">Github was experiencing some downtime</a>.  So I ended up fixing the script myself a slightly different way (seen below). I think James&rsquo;s approach is superior for a few reasons, not the least of which was avoiding the ugly if/elif/else found in my code by using a global counter. He also used .format() a lot better than I did, which I didn&rsquo;t know existed until I found it tonight.</p>

<p>I made two other changes before coming to my solution. First, I realized my regex was completely wrong. I didn&rsquo;t want to capture anything within the two parenthesis when no parenthesis were contained, as the original regex did. Instead, I wanted to make sure to preserve any parenthetical comments contained within my footnotes. So the resulting regex looks a bit different. I also switched from using user input to taking in the filepath as an argument.</p>

<p>My next step will be to learn a bit more about the os module which seems to contain what I need so that this Python script can behave like a good Unix script and know what to do with one file or a list of files as a parameter (and of course, most importantly, a list generated from a wild card like *.rst). I will also be incorporating the bits of James&rsquo;s code that I feel confident I understand and that I like better.</p>

<p>Without further ado, my solution (I updated the gist as well):</p>

<pre><code>:::python
from sys import argv
import re

name, file_path = argv

p = re.compile(r&quot;[\s]\(\((.*?[)]{0,1})\)\)[\s]{0,1}&quot;)
# The tricky part here is to match all text between &quot;((&quot;&quot;))&quot;, including as 
# many as one set of (), which may even terminate ))). The {0,1} captures as
# many as one ). The trailing space is there because I often surrounded the 
# &quot;((&quot;&quot;))&quot; with a space to make it clear in the WordPress editor.

# file_path = str(raw_input('File Name &gt;'))
text = open(file_path).read()

footnoteMatches = p.finditer(text)

coordinates = []
footnotes = []

# Print span of matches
for match in footnoteMatches:
    coordinates.append(match.span())
# Capture only group(1) so you get the content of the footnote, not the 
# whole pattern which includes the parenthesis delimiter.
    footnotes.append(match.group(1))

newText = []
for i in range(0, len(coordinates)):
    if i == 0:
        newText.append(''.join(text[:coordinates[i][0]] +
                               ' [^{}]').format(i + 1))
    elif i &lt; len(coordinates) - 1 :
        newText.append(''.join(text[coordinates[i-1][1]:coordinates[i][0]] +
                          ' [^{}]').format(i + 1))
    else:
        newText.append(''.join(text[coordinates[i-1][1]:coordinates[i][0]] +
                          ' [^{}]').format(i + 1))
        # Accounts for text after the last footnote which only runs once.
        newText.append(text[coordinates[i][1]:]+'\n')

endNotes = []
for j in range(0, len(footnotes)):
    insertList = ''.join(['\n','[^{}]: ', footnotes[j], '\n']).format(j + 1)
    endNotes.append(insertList)

newText = ''.join(newText) + '\n' + ''.join(endNotes)

newFile = open(file_path, 'w')
newFile.truncate()
newFile.write(newText)
newFile.close()
