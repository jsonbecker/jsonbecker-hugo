      <p>I have never found dictionaries or even a thesaurus particularly useful as part of the writing process. I like to blame this on my lack of <del>creative</del> careful writing.</p>

<p>But just maybe, I have simply been using the wrong dictionaries. It is hard not to be seduced by the seeming superiority of Webster&rsquo;s original style. A dictionary that is one-part explanatory and one-part <em>exploratory</em> provides a much richer experience of English as an enabler of ideas that transend meager vocabulary.</p>
