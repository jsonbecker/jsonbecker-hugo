<p>“We are trying to work towards late-exit ELL programs so (students) can learn the concepts in (their) native language,” Lusi said. Administrative goals have recently shifted to a focus on proficiency in both languages because bilingual education is preferred, she added.</p>

<p>But instituting district-wide bilingual education would require funding to hire teachers certified in both languages and to buy dual-language materials, she said.</p>

<p>I am pretty sure this is new. I am surprised there has not been a stronger effort to pass a legislative package in Rhode Island that provides both the policy framework and funding necessary to achieve universal bilinguage education for English language learners in RI schools.</p>

<p>One of the great advantages of transitioning to common standards<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:CCSS"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:CCSS">1</a></sup> is there should be greater availability of curricular materials in languages other than English. I suspect most of what is needed for bilingual education is start up money for materials, curriculum supports and developments, and assessment materials. There are a few policy things that need to be in place, possibly around state exams, but also rules around flexible teacher assignment, hiring, and dismissal staffing needs dramatically change.</p>

<p>Someone should be putting this package together. I suspect there would be broad support.</p>
