      <p>Although it clocks in at 40+ pages, this is a worthwhile and relatively fast read for anyone in education policy on the future of assessment if we&rsquo;re serious about college and career readiness. There is a ton to unpack, with a fair amount it agree with and a lot I am quite a bit less sure on.</p>

<p>I think this paper is meant for national and state level policy-makers, and so my major quibble is I think this is much more valuable for a district-level audience. I am less bullish on the state&rsquo;s role in building comprehensive assessment systems. That&rsquo;s just my initial reaction.</p>

<p>The accountability section is both less rich and less convincing than the assessment portion. I have long heard cries for so-called reciprocal accountability, but it is still entirely unclear to me what this means and looks like and the implications for current systems.</p>
