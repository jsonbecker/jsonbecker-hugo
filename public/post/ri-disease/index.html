      <p>When discussing policy in Rhode Island, I almost always encounter two bizarre arguments.</p>

<ol>
<li>Rhode Island is completely unique. Ideas from other places don&rsquo;t adequately take into account our local context. What is working there either won&rsquo;t work here or isn&rsquo;t really comparable to our situation here.</li>
<li>What is happening nationally is directly applicable to Rhode Island. We can make broad sweeping statements about a set of policies, ideas, or institutions currently in play in Rhode Island without any knowledge of how things are going locally and how it&rsquo;s different from other places. We can simply graft a broader national narrative onto Rhode Island regardless of whether it makes any sense with our facts on the ground.</li>
</ol>

<p>These seemingly in conflict points of view are often employed by the same actors.</p>

<p>It is probably not unique to Rhode Island, but that won&rsquo;t stop me from calling it <strong>Rhode Island Disease</strong>.</p>
