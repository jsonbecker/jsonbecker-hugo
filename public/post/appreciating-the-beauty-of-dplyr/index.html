      <p><a href="http://had.co.nz">Hadley Wickham</a> has <a href="https://github.com/hadley">once again</a><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:seriously"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:seriously">1</a></sup> made R ridiculously better. Not only is <code>dplyr</code> incredibly fast, but the new syntax allows for some really complex operations to be expressed in a ridiculously beautiful way.</p>

<p>Consider a data set, <code>course</code>, with a student identifier, <code>sid</code>, a course identifier, <code>courseno</code>, a quarter, <code>quarter</code>, and a grade on a scale of 0 to 4, <code>gpa</code>. What if I wanted to know the number of a courses a student has failed over the entire year, as defined by having an overall grade of less than a 1.0?</p>

<p>In dplyr:</p>

<pre><code class="language-r">course %.% 
group_by(sid, courseno) %.%
summarise(gpa = mean(gpa)) %.%
filter(gpa &lt;= 1.0) %.%
summarise(fails = n())
</code></pre>

<p>I refuse to even sully this post with the way I would have solved this problem in the past.</p>
