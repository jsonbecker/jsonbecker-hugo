      <p>If you&rsquo;re just beginning to use R and want a quick and easy way to make some charts/graphs, etc, GrapheR is a great package to quickly produce high quality plots through a self-explanatory GUI. <a href="http://journal.r-project.org/archive/2011-2/RJournal_2011-2_Herve.pdf">Here</a>&rsquo;s an article
in The R Journal today.</p>

<p>My only complaint is that GrapheR does not appear to have a way to export the code that produced the graph, which would be a very helpful feature for a beginner who wants to learn the guts of producing publication quality charts in R.</p>

<p>To install and then run&hellip;</p>

<pre><code class="language-r">install.packages('GrapheR')
require(GrapheR)
run.GrapheR()
</code></pre>
