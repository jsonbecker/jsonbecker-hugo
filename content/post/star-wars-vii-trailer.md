It has been said a thousand times before, but I feel the need to say it again. So much of what Star Wars got right was creating a fully realized, fascinating world. As much as stunning visual effects that have largely stood the test of time were a part of that story, it was how Star Wars *sounded* that is most remarkable.

Watch that trailer. It has moments that *look* an awful lot like Star Wars-- vast dunes in the middle of the desert, the Millenium Falcon speeding along, flipping at odd angles emphasizing its unique flat structure. But it also has a lot of elemetns that are decidedly modern and not Star Wars like. [^shakes] I think what's most remarkable is I can close my eyes and just listen. Immediately I can *hear* Star Wars. The sounds of Star Wars are not just iconic, they are deeply embedded in my psyche and embued with profound meaning.

I first had the opportunity to see Star Wars on the big screen it was during the release of the "Special Editions". There is nothing like hearing Star Wars in a theater.


[^shakes]: Shakey-cam is the primary culprit.
