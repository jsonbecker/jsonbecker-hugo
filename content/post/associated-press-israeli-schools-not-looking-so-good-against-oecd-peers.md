I read an interesting [article][] this morning on Israeli
schools. Facing extreme poverty among Arab-Israeli's and the
ultra-orthodox, Israel struggles to maintain three separate school
systems and succeed. It reminded me of some interesting centralized
policy reforms in Israel that have led to great natural experiments. For
example, so-called Maimonides Laws which capped class sizes at 40,
allowed for some really interesting regression-discontinuity studies on
the impact of class size [^classsize].

What I found most interesting in this article, however, was the point
made by Jon Medved:

> While agreeing Israeli schools need to raise their standards,
> technology entrepreneur Jon Medved doesn't think Israel's test scores

Two thoughts came to mind. First, we certainly are hearing in the United
States that employers are unhappy with the caliber of candidates for
open positions. It's unclear that in the US this is a result of low
aggregate skills or just tremendous mismatch between the skills that are
attained and the skills that are now valued in the marketplace. Second,
Israel's universal military service provides several additional years of
intense training and skill attainment even before college. Considering
the broad range of roles one can take on in the state military ((For
example, social workers in Israel are basically military trained, given
job experience, and then set out without a need for 5 years of
schooling, although I believe many do receive at least a bachelor's)),
it's hard not to see Israel's mandatory service as a massive vocational
educational program.

I don't have much analysis here, but mandatory public/civil service is
an interesting concept that this article will keep me thinking about
over the weekend.

Angrist has also done several other studies in Israel with Lavy, a nice
little summary of which is available here http://www.nber.org/reporter/summer03/angrist.html
