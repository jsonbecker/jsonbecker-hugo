If you're just beginning to use R and want a quick and easy way to make some charts/graphs, etc, GrapheR is a great package to quickly produce high quality plots through a self-explanatory GUI. [Here][]'s an article
in The R Journal today.

My only complaint is that GrapheR does not appear to have a way to export the code that produced the graph, which would be a very helpful feature for a beginner who wants to learn the guts of producing publication quality charts in R.

To install and then run...

    
```r
install.packages('GrapheR')
require(GrapheR)
run.GrapheR()
```
