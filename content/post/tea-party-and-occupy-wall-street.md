I wondered to myself If I could explain these two movements in a few sentences. Is this fair?

> The Occupy Wall Street movement is a response to the same two large
> government spending packages as well as the subsequently ineffectual
> American government during the first term of the Obama Presidency.
> These people are skeptical that the "bailout" and "stimulus" package
> addressed the challenges that the vast majority of Americans face
> every day in favor of addressing the needs of an elite economic and
> political class.
