I have not yet spent the time to figure out how to generate a [JSON feed](https://jsonfeed.org/) in Hugo yet. But I have built an R package to play with JSON feeds. It's called [jsonfeedr](https://github.com/jsonbecker/jsonfeedr), and it's silly simple.

Maybe I'll extend this in the future. I hope people will submit PRs to expand it. For now, I was inspired by all the talk about _why_ JSON feed even exists. Working with JSON is fun and easy. Working with XML is not.

Anyway, I figured the guy who registered [json.blog](http://json.blog) should have a package out there working with JSON.
