When discussing policy in Rhode Island, I almost always encounter two bizarre arguments.

1. Rhode Island is completely unique. Ideas from other places don't adequately take into account our local context. What is working there either won't work here or isn't really comparable to our situation here.
2. What is happening nationally is directly applicable to Rhode Island. We can make broad sweeping statements about a set of policies, ideas, or institutions currently in play in Rhode Island without any knowledge of how things are going locally and how it's different from other places. We can simply graft a broader national narrative onto Rhode Island regardless of whether it makes any sense with our facts on the ground.

These seemingly in conflict points of view are often employed by the same actors.

It is probably not unique to Rhode Island, but that won't stop me from calling it **Rhode Island Disease**.
