[Better Worlds](https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18055980/better-worlds-science-fiction-short-stories-video) is a series of 10 original science fiction stories commissioned by The Verge.

> Contemporary science fiction often feels fixated on a sort of pessimism that peers into the world of tomorrow and sees the apocalypse looming more often than not. At a time when simply reading the news is an exercise in exhaustion, anxiety, and fear, itâ€™s no surprise that so many of our tales about the future are dark amplifications of the greatest terrors of the present. But now more than ever, we also need the reverse: stories that inspire hope.

The Verge is at its best when it's not just a tech blog. I follow The Verge Long Reads in my RSS feed where some great journalism lives. But I still poke at the front page every couple of weeks because if I didn't, I'd miss projects like Better Worlds. I wish we had more journalism making enough money to do projects like this.
