You can check my [Goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5380958-jason). I love science fiction and fantasy. And I know in 2017 and everyone has already observed the dominance of "geek culture", with the dominance of Disney properties from Marvel and now Star Wars. Hell, [Suicide Squad won a goddamn Oscar](http://io9.gizmodo.com/suicide-squad-is-now-an-oscar-winning-movie-1792769922).

But I never felt like SFF was all that mainstream. SyFy might have made (and renewed) a TV series based on _The Magicians_, but I still feel like the disaffected entitled shit that held onto his love of genre fiction too long when I crawl into bed and hide in speculative fiction (thank you Quentin, for so completely capturing what a shit I was at 14).

Yesterday, I was confronted with the reality of SFF going mainstream at [Powell's City of Books](http://www.powells.com). I was fully unprepared to see the contents of their Best Selling Fiction shelf.

By my count, at least 16 of the top 42 are SFF. _The Name of the Wind_, _The Left Hand of Darkness_, _The Fifth Season_, _2312_, and _Uprooted_ are some of the best books I've ready in the last four or five years. To think of these books as best sellers when they don't have a TV show coming out (like _American Gods_, _The Handmaid's Tale_, _The Man in the High Castle_, and _The Magicians_) and aren't assigned in high school classrooms (_1984_, _Slaughterhouse-Five_) is just shocking. In my mind, these aren't best sellers, they're tiny nods between myself and other quiet bookshoppers that we are kin.

I am not sad though. I am thrilled. I want to live in a world where I can just assume acquaintances are reading _The Fifth Season_ and _Uprooted_.
