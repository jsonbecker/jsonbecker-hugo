I am pretty sure this is new. I am surprised there has not been a stronger effort to pass a legislative package in Rhode Island that provides both the policy framework and funding necessary to achieve universal bilinguage education for English language learners in RI schools.

One of the great advantages of transitioning to common standards[^CCSS] is there should be greater availability of curricular materials in languages other than English. I suspect most of what is needed for bilingual education is start up money for materials, curriculum supports and developments, and assessment materials. There are a few policy things that need to be in place, possibly around state exams, but also rules around flexible teacher assignment, hiring, and dismissal staffing needs dramatically change.

Someone should be putting this package together. I suspect there would be broad support.

[^CCSS]: Note, this is not necessarily a feature of the Common Core State Standards, just having standards in common with many other states.
