*Inspired by [Manton Reece](https://manton.org/now/), who was inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff), I too will include on [this page](https://micro.json.blog/now) what I'm thinking about and working on right now. This page will be updated semi-regularly as seems appropriate. The post date reflects when this was updated, and all Now pages will be archived and linked to from this page as regular posts as they are, themselves, updated.*

Here we are in 2020 facing down COVID-19 and expecting to spend the next several weeks if not months primarily at home. Luckily, we have a [room in our home I was able to turn into an office](https://micro.json.blog/2020/03/17/new-covid-workspace.html), and I can comfortably work from here. Still, it's hard to stay productive and keep my fears and anxiety even as we face so much uncertainty. For now, I'm taking some solace in the fact that I can continue to work, I am safe, and my family is safe. But I am afraid that a lot of change is coming, and it won't result in a safer and better world-- that's the kind of too-honest, invasive thinking that I'm hoping to ignore for at least a little longer.

I not-so-recently [got engaged](https://micro.json.blog/2020/01/01/the-first-ten.html).

I had spend the last couple of years working out quite diligently, lifting weights three times a week about 80% of the time and twice a week the remainder. In the end, although I enjoyed it, my inability to control my eating saw my weight and health decline to where I wasn't happy. I started counting calories again and I'm seeing results I feel good about. I'm going to try and reintroduce exercise now that things feel a bit more under control, and I'm hoping to have finally turned a corner on a lifelong battle with weight. I've done better than I'm doing now before, but this time feels easier and more sustainable than it's ever been.

Some of that is helped by [my obsession with the Bon App√©tit cinematic universe](https://jezebel.com/my-obsession-with-the-bon-appetit-cinematic-universe-1839497437), which has me enjoying cooking again, something I lost with the move from Providence to Baltimore. It's kind of amazing, but the stress of the year we moved combined with spending a year in a kitchen that felt cramped really hurt my enjoyment of cooking. But slowly in the last two and a half years since we moved to our current house, I've felt more and more interested in being in the kitchen and eating food we make again. It's a big difference.

And in truth, as difficult as this period of social distancing will be, the end of work travel for a prolonged period of time for the first time in six years means that routines are going to be easier to build and easier to keep than ever before. I miss the travel-- a lot-- but if I have to create some kind of silver lining, I think it has to be that routine feels possible again.
